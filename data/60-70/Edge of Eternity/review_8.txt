I had some hope the game would be decent at 80% discount but there are so many major issues to start with.


- City mini-map is way too close and barely tells you where to go for your quest no matter where you are.

- Emptiness all over. The map is inflated to make it feel like you're exploring vast areas. But it's just 3x bigger than it could've been.

- Poor directioning. The game tells you things like this : "go to *place name*, they're waiting for you"... Yeah? Where is it? It's a new game with new places and names, how dafuq do you expect anyone to be like "oh, seems straight foward enough, let's get going. It's right there". IT DOESN'T EVEN GIVE YOU ANY DIRECTION! At least tell us things like this "The exit's north-east from here through the commercial area, then look west from the gate and follow that path, you'll get there safely". Is it THAT complicated to give simple directions???

- Combat seems a bit stretched for very early game. It shouldn't take over a minute to beat a tutorial enemy. Too much health. 

- Shadow glitch after a few minutes, it flickers slowly a huge shadow like someone's playing with the lights.
