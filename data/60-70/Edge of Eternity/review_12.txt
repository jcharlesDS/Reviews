Very obvious in its being inspired by Final Fantasy as one would expect from "Midgar Studios", but those games are a rather ambitious target if a small studio chooses to aim for them. This game still has some fairly noticeable bugs 4 years after launch, but it looks like the developers are putting all their efforts into the new game.
So what's it like? The plot is interesting enough when you get past the first third or so and most of the voice actors do their jobs well (I've heard worse in Final Fantasy games), even though there are times where what has been written is delivered in a way that it seems it wasn't meant to be (lack of direction maybe). The tone is all over the place though, with some incredibly dark subjects being presented in a jolly manner, other seemingly less severe things getting the tone they deserve.
The combat isn't particularly difficult once you get a few levels under your belt, but it is where the majority of bugs show their heads. Semi-spoilers as far as the last encounter is concerned: Straight up Final Fantasy 7. If you like fighting a boss with so many phases that you get bored and want to do something else, this is the one for you!
The music is a high point, even if some of the compositions would probably get dragged through copyright court if Zelda and Final Fantasy's composers were as litigious as the music industry. One or two are easy to see what they were inspired by.
Overall it's not bad, but it definitely has issues that have driven a lot of people away.
