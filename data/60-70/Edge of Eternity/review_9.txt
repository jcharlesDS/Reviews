It has a lot of low-budget jank to struggle with early on before the story and gameplay elements have time to grow, but I'm liking it overall. I wish the cutscenes had a little more heart to them because I found parts of the story to be engaging but the presentation of it left a lot to be desired. The worst part is definitely the U. If you can get past that stuff there's something very unique here that's worth a look if you are into RPGs, especially if it's on sale.
