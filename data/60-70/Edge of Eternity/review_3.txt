Made with absolutely no budget, free assets and animations from Unity, way too many bugs with UI, graphical and audio and so many more issues... but still appealing. I can't decide if it's the strategic combat, searching for loot boxes and stuff or way too ambitious story for this amount of budget but...I still like it.

If you get this game for REALLY cheap then you can pick up this extremely flawed product up. Otherwise there is a lot more coherent titles similar to this out there.
