Note : 👎

Not only is it impossible to jump in this game and because of this the main character cannot overcome even the smallest fence, there is also no normal map and sometimes it is impossible to understand where you are from the minimap. Plus, for some reason my game doesn't start with the prologue and tutorial that it should and that I saw on YouTube, but immediately with the arrival of the ship to the city. I started a new game several times and every time it's the same thing
