Note : 👍

So far, it's pretty much exactly what I expected. Janky, for sure...But very much like an old school JRPG but 3D instead of sprite-based. A lot like Dragon Quest 8 and Final Fantasy 10.

Wish the minimap could be zoomed. Really annoying in the very first town that you can't even see a map of the whole town at once. But whatever, I found all the treasure chests there anyway. There are treasure chests at dead ends, even in town.

I'll have to see how the systems (crystals, etc.) work. Basic combat is as expected. I wish it had tooltips on everything...That's a modern QoL old school JRPGs never had. But they came with printed manuals, too.

But it is pretty and controls well with both controller and mouse.

I'll add to this review as I play.
