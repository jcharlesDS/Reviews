Note : 👍

Game starts out rather slow and not very interesting, it picks up after chapter 1, and gets only better.
 Content is unique along with its story, you get to control party of 4 with option to switch out members, and build their abilities, armor, weapons. You travel open world, mostly load screens when you talk, teleport and story sequences. Each companion has its own short story.
Can buy the game dirt cheap and its worth it.
