This happens to be one of my favorite games of all time! Slender: The Arrival is the greatest Slender game of all time! This game took the original Slender The Eight Pages and expertly made an amazing, terrifying, story-rich experience. Everything in this game feel so real. The forest, mines, and farm are all so enthralling. The mine in particular is so freaking scary. It takes the horror factor to a new level. TERROR and ANXIETY is what is felt down there. Some areas even introduce new enemies. There is just too much to gush about.  I can't even begin to praise this game enough. Over the first few years, the developers added more chapters to the game. I have played through this game probably like 15 times. What's even more crazy is after nearly 10 years the developers remastered the game for Unreal Engine 5, and released it as a free update. And even added another new chapter.... ALL FOR FREE, TEN YEARS LATER! Even crazier now they are making DLC for this game. WOW! Anyway game is incredible! PLAY THIS ONE FOR SURE!
