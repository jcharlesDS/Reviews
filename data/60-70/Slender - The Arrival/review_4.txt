This is THE DEFINITIVE Slenderman game. The developers are still so passionate for the game, and I can't wait for the promised updates to be delivered. It's a beautiful game with a great story, amazing character designs. It's just unfortunate that Slenderman isn't much of a villain in this as he should be.
