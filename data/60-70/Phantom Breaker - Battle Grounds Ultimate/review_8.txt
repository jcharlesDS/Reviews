No matter how many times they re-release it, imma still buy it. Hands down the best Phantom Breaker game, and this Ultimate edition is amazing! -- Honestly, only thing it needs? MORE STAGES. Love the original, love this one, but man we need a Phantom Breaker Battleground 2, or some DLC pack with more stages/bosses/PVE content etc.
