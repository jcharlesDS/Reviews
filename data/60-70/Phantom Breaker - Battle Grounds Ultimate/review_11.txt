If you like beatemups, this is a must play. If you played the original game and haven't played for a while, this is a nice remaster as well. It still has the fun gameplay with a few minor additions. On normal difficulty, the difficulty has been dialed down. I remember the original being more unforgiving during my first playthrough. 

Overall a very fun remaster, but as a longtime fan, I wish they made a sequel instead. I know they'd have to find a new voice actress for Waka, but the story has remained untouched for more than a decade, it should be nigh time to continue it.
