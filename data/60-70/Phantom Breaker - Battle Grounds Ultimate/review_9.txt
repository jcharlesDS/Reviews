Note : 👎

The only notable addition to this deluxe version, are enemy characters included in the roster. 

Remaster is false advertisement. 

I beat it earlier, and this is literally the same feature-wise as the vanilla game. 

Could not tell any balancing or minor changes even. Main characters movesets are same.

Not worth $25, unless you are a newcomer. 

For people returning, $10 is being generous for what is essentially DLC adding half-baked enemy characters with reduced movesets.
