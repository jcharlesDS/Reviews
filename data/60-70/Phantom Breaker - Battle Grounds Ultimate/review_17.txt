Steam deck IMO runs perfectly out of the box.

The same beloved game, a fresh coat of paint, pumped up to 11.
It's no secret, I love Phantom Breaker and have purchased and played every re-release and Omnia.
If you're a returning fan or new to this franchise, I highly recommend picking this version up.
