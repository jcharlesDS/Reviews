Note : 👍

i really wish that leveling was just for stats, if anything, or that arcade mode made it so you played with maxed out characters and was balanced for that. because now there's over 30 characters and starting a new character with no abilities who can't even dash or double jump is insane. i saw a review that said to slow down the XP rate and don't ever listen to that guy, he is a masochist.

but the game is really really fun so you should get it anyway
