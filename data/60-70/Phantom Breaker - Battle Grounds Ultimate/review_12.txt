Impressively, this has to be the worst feeling beat 'em up I've ever played.  If you don't go full aggro ham on the enemies immediately, they'll hit you once.  At this point, all 30 of them will overlap and gang up on you, and proceed to infini-juggle you to death.

It's as awful playing as it is to read.
