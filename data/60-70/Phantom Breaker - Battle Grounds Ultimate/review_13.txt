In general - average experience. Battles mostly are mindless button mashers with a lot of enemies. You have 2 lines, you can get level ups, improve some stat, skills, drops.

Good:
- Lot of characters to play
- Has 6 player coop mode and 8 player pvp
- Visuals are good
- Crossplay
- Local play (only 4 people)
- Progression with leveling and some drops

Bad:
- Not much of explaining how stuff work. Tips are hidden behind 'Reference' option, instead of saying FAQ, Help, Tips, Manual, etc. Even with that I don't really understand what are coins and what they are needed for
- You cannot join mid game. This in combo with low online leads to situation, where having online experience is being very lucky. If you achievement hunter it would be hard to to get few achievements that are bound to online
- You can't combine local play with online. Meaning that if you wan't to play 2 people on your pc + 4/6 people from online you won't be able to do so
- Even if some good mechanics exist battles are mostly pressing the same button/combo over and over again. Some of those mechanics bring more harm in the game. Like recovering mid air. You get hit - you recover mid air - you hit again - repeat until you're dead
- Most of battles on last difficulties is just mob of enemies. Some of them, like flying enemies, are real pain because even with 3 jumps it's hard to get enemy. Add here that sometimes you don't know what line enemy on (you can see their shadow sometimes, but lot of time you don't). Getting stunlocked by 2 flying drones? Very easy. Yes, you can try to spend you ult gauge, to un-stunlock yourself, but it's still not fun
- Sometimes controls feel unresponsive, for example turning button
- Even if you turn music volume to 0 it still plays
- Because xp is bound to drop from the enemy, you don't really want to play online to level up. Because in coop mode everyone have same drop. So if someone grabs the gems, you won't be able to get them. I'm not totally sure about it, but game doesn't give you any tips.
- Most of enemy characters are half assed and don't have skill trees. So you can just improve their Str/Def/Spd stats
- Online is very low

TLDR
Mediocre button masher with a lot of characters. Could be fun to play in a group via local play or online (if you could find a game). You don't really need much, just mash those buttons, or use macro/turbo.
