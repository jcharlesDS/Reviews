let me start off by saying i love that Rocket Panda Games is keeping this series alive. I've been a fan of the Phantom breaker series since i came across the original Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds on Xbox 360.

Now Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is a full on remake made in Unreal Engine 5. This version of Battle Grounds aims to be as faithful to the original and Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds OverDrive and let me just say it passes that in every aspect. everything that you know from the original is here. 

In terms of the visuals it looks absolutely amazing this game is so well detailed its beyond amazing.

Combat feels super fluid and responsive chaining attacks together feels so satisfying and super moves are so well animated 

The music has been Remixed for this version of Battle Grounds and it sounds amazing but if you're not a fan of it you can switch it to the original

The English cast from Phantom Breaker: Omnia returns in this game so now you can enjoy the story with the English Dub but you still have the option to switch to the Japanese voices if you wish

Overall Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is a MASSIVE love letter to not only fans of the Phantom Breaker series but also to fans of Beat 'em ups. This game deserves a 10/10 its that good of a beat 'em up
