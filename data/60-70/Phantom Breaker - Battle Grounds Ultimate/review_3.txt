This isn't your OG Battlegrounds. No sir!

A mix of both Omnia and Battlegrounds, Ultimate is back and ready for Shenanigans. 
6 player co-op? Yes sir. Don't mind if I bully every enemy and boss. 
8 player BG mode? Heck yes. It has team battling! From 4v4 to 2 on 2s, there is something for someone, regardless of skill. 

Some of the playable NPCS are broken, and may need some tweaking to remain balanced.

The replayability lies in leveling every character online. Passive items have been introduced in Ultimate that can make solo runs not such a "nightmare". From raising stats to providing a temp HP regen, it just works.

Crossplay is a blessing which allows more players to join up in public/private instances. I was impressed with how tolerable the online sessions were aside the low FPS dips here and there. This is a step up, and will hopefully be a staple in the next Phantom Breaker Game.

As always, thanks Rocket Panda Games!
