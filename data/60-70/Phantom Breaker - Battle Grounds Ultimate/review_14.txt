Still Super fun, but i feel like the exp rate early game... look i did a single playthrough on hard story mode so far and i'm level 75. the game feels easier and the exp rate is super fast and i would love to see a patch to slow down the exp rate.

as for co op, i haven't tried playing with my EU friend cause, well, hes asleep but well see if it holds tomorrow >:D (will edit in future)

i didn't know about outrange items in previous variations but the menus are easier to traverse so maybe i just missed them., the game feels a lot smoother as well, even if it is locked to 60 fps. that doesn't bother me personally.

also they forgot the exit game button LOL...good thing alt+f4 exists
