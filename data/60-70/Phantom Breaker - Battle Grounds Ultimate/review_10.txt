I had the original game back in the day and I really only played it a little before not playing it further.  At the time I didn't like how it forced you into lanes and it felt kinda samey from screen to screen with the overwhelming number of enemies.  For whatever reason I liked it this time around.  The combos and counters and different fighting game mechanics are pretty awesome and as the game goes on the enemy diversity increases and while often hack and slash oriented, it definitely has more depth than I was aware of.  When playing co op, it adds a bunch of extra complexity to it and the harder difficulties definitely actually become hard and require using some of the more nuanced techniques.  Each of the 4 girls plays differently enough to make it worth while and they all have voice acting and somewhat different stories.  No complaints on my end.
