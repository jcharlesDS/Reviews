Note : 👎

Game is poorly optimised for pc. Many of the controls simply don't make sense. Extremely limited character customisation that you can't even see change. Worst problem about this game is that you can't uninstall it from Steam. It will stay on your PC even after you've uninstalled it through Steam. You need to go into your files and find it in order to remove it.
There is something good in this game though. How the guns work. Probably the best I've seen in any game with guns in them.
