Note : 👍

This game is pretty fun, I enjoy the world and story, but I have two pet peeves.

1: The story treated me like a guy, even though I played as a girl.

2: The whole friendship system was confusing and I had no idea when to press the weirdly chosen key to comment on my teammates good work.

Beyond that, great game!
