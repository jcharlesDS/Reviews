Note : 👎

Would only buy this if it goes on sale. The UI and UX are not great and you will constantly fight weird and crappy design decisions.
It can't go above 60fps modding it to do so will make the enemy's behave like they are on crack.
and no one plays multiplayer so that's a feature you won't get to play.
Story is eh..
If you are a hard core SAO fan and it its on sale get it otherwise don't.
