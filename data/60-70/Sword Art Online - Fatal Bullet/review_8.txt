Note : 👎

Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet had potential, but unfortunately, it falls flat in execution. The tutorial alone is long and boring, dragging on far longer than necessary before you actually get into the action. You’ll find yourself stuck in a repetitive cycle of being sent to one place, going back to the original area, then being sent to the same place again—like a glorified walking simulator.

When you finally engage in combat, the controls feel clunky and unpolished. Auto-assist makes it even worse, as it feels like you're finally the POV of a cheater in a shooter game, thus removing any sense of challenge or skill.

That being said, there are a few upsides: the character customization is decent, some of the RPG mechanics are interesting, and if you’re a hardcore SAO fan, there’s enjoyment to be found in the world-building. But overall, Fatal Bullet fails to deliver an exciting or engaging experience.
