Note : 👍

Unless your a fan of the series i wont really heavily recommend the game
gun play is good
I actually had this on my now dead PS4. playing on a mosue and keyboard made this game really really better
also being PC gave me options to enjoy questionable skin mods XD
to make it short 
if your a fan you can enjoy this game
if not there is still fun to be had but the cringey story and and the non stop voice over at everything can get tedious

overall i really prefer this than the mainline series of games since I can self insert myself
