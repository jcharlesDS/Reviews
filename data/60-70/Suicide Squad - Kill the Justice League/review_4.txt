Suicide Squad is fine... After the pretty terrible launch period and a multitude of updates the game is.. Fine.

It's major issues are; the server/connection issues, complete lack of mission variety and the fact it's a live service game and all the baggage that comes along with that. Aside from that however this games biggest issue is that it's *the* AAA Justice League game and is the first time these characters have been shown in this high fidelity in video game form only to have them all killed off pretty unceremoniously.. I think for a lot of people this was a pretty big deal breaker.

What you're left with is a repetitive, live service looter shooter with pretty fun movement where the humour landed more often than not once I accepted that this game was in it's own universe. 

Here's hoping we do get that Justice League game one day though.

(P.S. shout out to the Gamemast15r for recommending this game, I hear it's one of it's faves!)
