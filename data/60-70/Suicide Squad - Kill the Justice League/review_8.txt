for 12 bucks, I'm literally on cloud 9. 
The game is a story game so its completely story focused so far but I'm liking it. So far I've had one glitch that wasn't game breaking, my bot squad mates went invisible in co-op.
The game rewarded me with numerous excellent items and a free battle pass. 
I understand the gripes, for an almost 100$ game. But i got it for 12 bucks, so I'm winning.
