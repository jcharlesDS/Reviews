💥 Title: "More Like ‘Suicide Squad: Kill My Hopes and Dreams’"

Review:

Well, well, well… Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, huh? This game promised us a chaotic, hilarious, over-the-top adventure with supervillains taking on the Justice League. What we got, however, was more like a slow, painful stroll through a dystopian, bug-filled nightmare. And I’m not just talking about the bugs in the game—I’m talking about the bugs in the game.

The Plot: The story? Okay, I’ll give it credit, it had some potential. The Suicide Squad—Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark (who, by the way, spends 80% of his time trying to be the funny one) are sent to stop the Justice League, who’s apparently been brainwashed by Brainiac. Pretty cool setup, right? Then they throw in some weird, forced humor that feels like it came straight from an AI trying to mimic Deadpool’s comedy style… and it’s about as funny as a dad joke at a funeral.

Gameplay: Oh boy. The gameplay is where this really falls apart. The combat is as satisfying as punching a wet noodle. You’re controlling these characters, but it feels like you’re walking through an open-world mall where the most exciting thing to do is spam a button and pray your attacks don’t look as awkward as they feel.

You know what’s not fun? When I’m playing as a giant shark-man with superpowers and I’m still getting stuck in corners or being knocked over by enemies who can’t even get their own balance right. You’d think a shark would have better agility, but nope! King Shark’s moves are as sluggish as my Wi-Fi connection during an online class.

Co-op Mode:
Co-op is supposed to be the highlight of a game like this, right? Wrong. The second I tried to join a friend, the lag kicked in so hard I thought I was playing in a broken refrigerator. My character was teleporting around the map like a drunk teleporter, and I have no idea what was happening with my friend's character—they were just... gone? I guess they’re out there living their best life while I’m stuck in a buggy mess.

Oh, and don’t even get me started on teamwork. Every character has different abilities, but apparently, the game didn’t get the memo that they were supposed to work together. I’ve had Booster Shot (Deadshot) literally shoot me in the back while trying to revive a teammate. And Captain Boomerang? He literally ran the other way, tossing boomerangs into random walls. Thanks, buddy, that’s super helpful.

Graphics & Sound: Okay, the graphics look decent-ish, but honestly, they’re a little too shiny for a world that’s supposed to be dark and grim. It feels like they tried to go for realism, but ended up with something that looked like an overly-glossy comic book. Meanwhile, the sound effects were the same thing over and over. Boom, bang, and then… “What’s going on?!” No variety in the noises, no fresh content. It’s like listening to the same two songs on repeat for 10 hours.

Bugs/Performance: Oh, and did I mention bugs? I don’t mean the ones the Suicide Squad is fighting, I mean the ones in the game. I was running through a building when Deadshot suddenly got stuck in a wall. Captain Boomerang got stuck in a tree for five minutes while trying to boomerang his way out. Don’t even ask about the times I’ve been teleported into oblivion because the game decided it was time to send me to the game development equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle.

Final Thoughts: So, here’s the thing: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League isn’t a game about killing the Justice League. It’s about killing your enthusiasm, your patience, and, if you’re not careful, your will to live. If you’re looking for a fun, chaotic time, try playing a rock, paper, scissors simulator. Or maybe throw a dart at the wall and see what happens. Either way, it’s probably a more rewarding experience than this.

2/10 – Would not recommend. Would rather let the Justice League win.

P.S. I’d rather be stuck in a room with Batman giving me a 3-hour lecture on justice than deal with this game’s bugs.
