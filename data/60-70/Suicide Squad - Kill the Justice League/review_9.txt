Tried to like it, but it's just too much like a dreadful Live-service game. Too much focus on allowing 4 player co-op, not enough on actually making the game interesting or fun. The cutscenes are very well made, the story seems ok for what little I saw, but the voice acting sounds like an amateur improv team doing their "best" impressions, just lacks any semblance of professionalism from top to bottom. The gameplay feels janky like Saints Row, just not one of the good ones. Even the initial loading screen is bland and lifeless. The game probably could have been decent had they dropped the whole co-op play and focused on the single player angle instead. Oh well only paid around $9, well within the throwaway range.

Having a hard time finding anything redeeming enough to make me want to play more. If your curious, buy it on sale, it's just meh.
