Note : 👎

This is gonna be controversial, but I love the game. I love the design, the controls, the story, the characters. I don't mind the repetitiveness of this game. The problem is: I literally cannot play the game online anymore due to bugs. I cannot join games, I cannot invite people, I cannot change game mode - basically the game is broken. I started this story with friends, and I am not gonna continue alone. This is just unplayable, I recommend not buying this.
