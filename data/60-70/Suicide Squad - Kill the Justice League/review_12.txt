Gameplay was alittle choppy here & there, yet the game is good! Might get repetitive but as a superhero/villain fan, this was worth it. Honestly if it wasn’t for my achievements not popping, I’d kept this game & finished it. Truly was a big turn off for me. Achievements drive me to completion of any video game.
