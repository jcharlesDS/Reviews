Note : 👍

This game is too damn good:
+ Real Time Strategy cards game
+ Steam punk robots
+ Independace war
+ Nice story with Comics like scenes between fights
+ Nice adds-on (first for Campaign playing Vilain, second with 2news factions for multiplaying)

- Lack of players for multi ...
- Native and Mercenaries are too strong (so i play only them :S)
