Postal 2 was a legendary game for its time, but this game is a overall embarrassment and failure, devs have lost their touch 20 years later. They lost the balls making offensive jokes. Postal 4 is still janky its broken the graphics and visuals look like shit, the map looks like shit, the way the buildings were placed since early access and the whole environment look completly out of place everything sticks out nothing makes sense. Speaking of early access this game was a red flag all along they abused the early access and no real improvments were made nor have they listend to legit good feedback. The game is now out of early access like 2 years ago and its still janky its buggy its unfinished, and they waste all their time and money to work on Co-op and other trash rather then fixing this game. Everything for almost 40 euros.

This game is bad in every aspect and does not even come close what they managed 20 years ago with Postal 2, really a shame
