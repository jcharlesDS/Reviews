lots of bugs crashed sometimes on me but honestly, it was still funny to have it crash. I had a lot of fun on it, it on the same grounds as postal 2 with some good gags, jokes, shiggles, and gits. Some cutscenes feel unresolved tho but honestly storytelling isn't usually the main priority about some Dude who lost his trailer home. Also some geometry of this games is weird I found myself constantly crashing on small polygons and flipping into outerspace (fuck those dumbass ufos) anyways besides the bugs, unresolved cutscenes it's still a fun game, espiacially for messing around for shiggles and giggles.
