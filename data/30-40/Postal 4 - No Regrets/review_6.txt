Note : 👍

+ Pros: 
+Not Postal III
- cons:
-Bugged as fuk
-regression in the form of NPC behavior.
-Shi!@# map.
-Gunplay does not exist.
-Optimization
-Worse humor compared to Postal 2.
-Worse immersion of the living city, NPCs walk around without any purpose.

Even though the game is hopeless and has a huge regression in terms of NPC intelligence and general gunplay... 
 I recommend it because it's still POSTAL, it's just a shame that the Devs are ret@rded and can't make a game that would be even 30% as good as POSTAL 2

Have fun dudes
