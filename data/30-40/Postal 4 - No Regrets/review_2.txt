The other day I ate an amazing burger, I mean it was soooo good. The beef was grilled wth just a touch of char, with a toasted bun. And the toppings! don't get me started fresh ripe tomatoe slices, relish, mayo, a touch of ranch, a pile of fried onions. man I am sure I forgot something like the mushrooms, or the cheese curds. I gotta go get a burger.
