Bought this game on early access in 2019, because for some reasons I loved Postal 2 somewhere in the past (don't judge me). Seems like I had some hopes for what could have been the true spiritual successor to this weird but unique game; I mean, the devs really seemed to want to do that.
How naive I was.
We're in 2025 and this game is a pure disaster. It's unplayable. Everything is bad, the gameplay, AI, story, missions, graphics, performances... And the humor too. Yes Postal 2 had "bad humor", but "bad" like in "don't take that seriously, it's absurd and stupid". Here it's just cringe.
But the main issue is that after all this years it has become clear that RWS has absolutely no idea of how to make a game. They clearly have no sense of priority, and don't want to even try to make a decent game. Sometimes we should know where to stop a massacre.
Okay, a few cutscenes are fun if you manage to play more than 5 minutes, but don't waste your time.
I heavily "regert" giving this a chance...
