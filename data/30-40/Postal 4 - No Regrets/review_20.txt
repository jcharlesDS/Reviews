Note : 👎

I hate to give this game a negative rating because it can be fun in short bursts but it seriously needs work if you haven't bought the game yet I would recommended waiting until rws releases more optimization and bug patches 
but even if the game does get that  I have some other issues with the game
- almost every building in game is empty 
- getting to each errand takes FOREVER even with a scooter like in postal 2 it would take me at most two minutes to get to the next mission but in postal 4 it can take me up to five and that's not even including the time I take to explore the map and find money and weapons and all the side missions are either very tedious or the most simple task ever
- killing npcs gets boring quickly 
- a TON of the missions are just slogs to get through (I also personally prefer the more mundane style of errands from postal 2 over the more comical ones from postal 4)
and personally  I think the games humor feels very watered down like it feels like the game wants to be offensive but at same time its scared to actually offended anyone so instead it makes the same few jokes that almost every other dark comedy product has ever made constantly. 
I do have to commended rws for still updating this game since launch and adding new content to the game but with the state its in now I cannot recommend Postal 4 hopefully I can come back to this game after a while and have way more positive thoughts on it but I'll just have to wait for now.
