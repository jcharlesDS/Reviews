Overall I would say not as good as Postal 2 but still very solid. Main issues are glitches, lag, random crashes and the difficulty. The game's difficulty tends to be a rollercoaster, a lot of bosses and sections in general can be cheesed because killing someone or a boss losing health will be remembered. But on the other extreme, there are bosses and sections which restore the health of everything but unlike in Postal 2, you don't get ammo back forcing you to load old saves. 

If you're mainly in it for the story (like I was) or you just want to do more dumb things to npcs like you did in Postal 2 than this game is worth purchasing but if you liked the challenge of the Postal 2 DLC then you should wait for the patch coming soon which attempts to make the difficulty more consistent with Postal 2
