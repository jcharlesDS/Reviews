If you were a fan of POSTAL 2 and you're looking for something modern to scracth that itch then POSTAL 4 is the call. yea it's a bit janky but POSTAL 2 wasn't some magnum opus so i'm not sure why people are holding POSTAL 4 to such high standards. 

everything you could do in POSTAL 2 you can do here and MORE. Yea it's a work in progress from a small passionate team trying to give their fans something they could enjoy, something that isn't POSTAL 3.

It's fun and they're continuing to work on it which is another big plus! thanks RWS for letting me pee on that old lady i murdered with a shovel!
