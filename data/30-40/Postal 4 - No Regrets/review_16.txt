i love the postal series Postal 1 & 2 are the best Postal games Running With Scissors has made PERIOD ! , but Postal 4 No Regerts is just terrible way to many bugs the graphics are okay and serviceable at best as well as the story line is fine but that is all i can say the story line is FINE , feel like the game is not trying to be edgy enough compared to its Predecessors seems to be toned a lot  the FPS drops and stutters are incredibly ridiculous. with loading screens in between moving different zones you would of thought would have got that right its even more worse with CO-OP with even more bugs of falling to the map and mission scripts not working properly in co-op , not trying to hate on this game as i do love the postal series but i feel like this game needed a lot more time in development i would say if your a die hard postal fan buy it otherwise just buy Postal 2 instead
