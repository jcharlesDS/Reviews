The real master thieves are the poeple who actually charged money for this unfinished mess of a game...

You can soft-lock the game at several points, some mechanics straight up doesn't work, the game is generally lacking in content and the story... well it could almost create a new term: "AberLore".

If you play the game just to see how much you are able to break it then it might be a bit amusing, however I could not even attempt this as everytime i was finished with a dialogue in the game everything just froze and i had to Alt F4, meaning i could literally not even play it at all which was nice as it spared my time from wasting it on this atrocious game.

The game kept throwing achivements at me everytime i closed it (which i had not earned btw), as in a desperate attempt at making me come back to it.
