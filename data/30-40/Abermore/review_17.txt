Note : 👎

a technical mess with a lot of promise 
would need a ton of work, but it doesn't seem like its getting that 

21:9 support is missing, menus are all messed up when its not in 16:9 
you constantly see through walls 
and can often fall through them or get stuck inside them, 
performance is also abysmal and appears to be capped at 60fps 
regardless of vsync 

I really like the art style, atmosphere, story and characters 
the movement feels pretty good and stealth mechanics work well 

would love to recommend this game, 
but sadly cant.
