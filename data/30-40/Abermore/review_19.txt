Note : 👎

As loathe as I am to submit this (because there's a great game here!), I can't recommend this based on bugs alone.

- The inventory system barely works; items keep covering up other items in the inventory, then dragging them around causes all sorts of weirdness.
- Every level I played had massive gaping holes in the geometry, specifically around stairs with not a single set of them appearing without an issue.
- I was bumped out of the level geometry while crawling through a vent. I was able to get back inside in that case though.
- I finished a quest but the person refused to acknowledge that I'd finished the quest so I couldn't progress their mission, because the level wasn't selectable again (as I'd already finished it!).
- A dude pushed me out of the level geometry and into a cupboard, leaving me to be stuck while they sounded an alarm and I could do nothing but sit there waiting for the timer to go down.

With all the above problems, it really does pain me to say "don't buy it just yet". It's so much fun and would be brilliant if it weren't so broken. I was willing to push through all the bugs and weirdness because I was having a great time stealing stuff, knocking people out, sneaking about and selling my ill-gotten goods, but one thing after another wore me down. The playground here is fun, the abilities are a nice twist, the moment-to-moment gameplay is satisfying, but it's just so broken.

I will happily amend this review to a positive if some fixes come out, but until then I can't recommend it.
