read the [url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vnpv/abermore-is-an-almost-great-bad-game]waypoint review[/url], & the twitter thread linked therein, which lays it all out.

what could have been a really clever & well-scoped indie imsim, sabotaged by bad management & released essentially as an unpatchable beta.

i genuinely enjoy the game when it works, but i cannot recommend it unless you have a deep well of patience & an understanding of the material conditions under which it was made.

solidarity with the devs, & hoping Lady Luck sees them land on their feet ✊♥
