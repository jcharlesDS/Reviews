This game is for freaks only.

Are you a Thief freak? Someone who will play anything that even remotely resembles the Thief games? If you said yes then this game is for you. Otherwise you might just get angry.

Abermore has personality. Like the climbing system that I haven't come across anywhere else. Or the Gutter and its inhabitants, I just love the game's random NPC generator's tendency to create the most hipster looking individuals. All the environments are quite charming. The writing is generally nice and at times really good! A definite highlight of the whole game. The small nuggets of story and worldbuilding paint a picture of a magic realist place. It's clear the developers love immersive sims and their worlds.

I had to download a Unity debug tool so I could access the game's files on runtime and save myself from situations that were game breaking. I had to rely on this tool more than once. Actually pretty often. This would be my recommended way of experiencing the game. It is not the way games should be played I know, but as someone who makes games I had fun exploring the files and seeing how I can untangle the mess the game world was in. Now if that is not immersive simulation I don't know what is!

Abermore has its own style,  a thing I think should not be taken as granted. The developers had a vision and that shows. Making video games is hard and making immersive sims is even harder. So I applaud the devs for making one and giving us a glimpse of a world with personality and quirkiness.
