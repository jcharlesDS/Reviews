Alright well, this is just sad. Were it an early access, it would be pretty alright. 

Not ignoring a good idea though. This game has lots of really nifty small ideas and mechanics. Some of which make it feel like a Thief game, yeah. 

But it is so incredibly rough:
Clipping through walls, "ability" to see through whole chunks of the area when by simply going upstairs. AI getting literally stuck when they decide notice something odd. Oh and are you a fan of gameplay where you have to quickly do what you gotta do and scram? Well, the game can provide it. By somehow glitching and triggering alarm the moment you load into the area.
And of course moments when AI literally doesn't react to you breaking glass in a room nearby. (Though maybe it's a difficulty thing, but it's really hard to tell) 

This game would be a lot more passable if it was an Early Access. But it's not, or maybe it's just not stated as such? Mystery. 

So yeah, not worth it. Not in its current state at least.
