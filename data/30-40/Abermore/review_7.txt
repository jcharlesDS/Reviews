Note : 👎

I'd love to recommend this game, truly. It has so many unique systems and the gameplay loop is solid. It's *almost* a good time. I played three or four missions with the hope of "well I've unlocked more the game and things are getting a little bit more difficult, maybe it gets better? But it doesn't. 

This game is ruined by the fact that it probably needed another six months of development. Bad procedural generation means that elements clip in to eachother, bad alphas on the backsides of staircases, gaps between floors, and staircases that lead nowhere. Poor UI with few button prompts for things like viewing different floors on your map. Bugs with item duplication in your inventory and hit boxes.

I was really hopeful that this would finally give a stealth & heist game worth sinking my time into but unfortunately, this is not that. I hope it receives some updates and that I'll be able to return to it.
