Note : 👎

I am enjoying the pieces of what Abermore could have been, but that takes patience, imagination, and a whole lot of forgiveness. This game is much too broken to be released to paying audiences like this. It starts with bad framerates and slows down over the course of a mission to an unplayable slideshow of 5fps. Level geometry is missing walls and ceilings. Clipping out of the level is commonplace. Lights dont work. AIs fail at pathfinding. I had the Y axis of my mouselook go wild and then eventually lock up. The UI is plagued with constant full screen flashes of broken polygons. I havent had a single session that wasnt deeply broken.

But in among all that, and despite the stealth systems being rudimentary to the point of bad, there is something at the core of this game. I am enjoying the light touch weird worldbuilding in the quests and npcs, and in the moments between the game's brokenness I find myself liking what they were going for. Not what they actually produced, mind you, just what I can see in it.
