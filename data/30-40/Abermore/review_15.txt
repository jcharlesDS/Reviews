Note : 👎

This game had a lot of promise, but utterly failed to execute on any of it. It's remarkably buggy, badly tutorialised, systems vary from nonsensical to nonfunctional, and you can't even see the controls in-game. I really wanted to like this! But this isn't a new Thief, this isn't even a new Thi4f. This game badly needs a patch, if not a complete rebuild.
