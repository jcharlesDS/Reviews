I was so excited for this game and gosh, what a disappointment. The first sign of trouble was when I got the "no detections" achievement right at the main menu, but at least the opening sequence seemed promising. In the tutorial mission I noticed that the upstairs walls were invisible, but at least I was able to clear it. Everything beyond that point was a disaster. I clipped out of bounds every time I would attempt another mission (not even by doing anything weird! simply crawling through a vent was enough) and would have to quit the game -- which would put me back at the beginning of the same day, meaning I had to repeat all the conversations and shopping every time.

I'm shelving this game for now so I don't go over the threshold for refund eligibility. I really hope a patch comes out because there's a lot of promise here but...until that happens it's not remotely worth the money.
