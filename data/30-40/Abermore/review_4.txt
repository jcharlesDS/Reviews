Note : 👎

I wish that I could recommend this game. It has some really interesting idea, which I would have loved to get deeper into, but it is absolutely riddled with irritating and immersion-breaking bugs, to the point where it is essentially unplayable 

In the first hour, I experienced bugs with the UI, level generation, achievements, the inventory, and held items disappearing/becoming unusable. And if you need to restart the game to fix a bug, you lose all progress on your current mission, as the only method of saving the game is an autosave at the beginning of each day (which the game doesn't warn you about when you try to quit)

Possibly the worst part of all is that these bugs are so obvious, and seemingly so frequent, that there's no way the developers weren't aware of them, yet they chose  to release the game in this state anyway, and to charge people for the privilege of figuring out just how broken it is.
