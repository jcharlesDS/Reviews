I really wanted to enjoy Abermore. I was hyped for it before launch atfer reading an article about how it was basically rogue-lite thief. A roguelite immersive sim? Sign me up! 

Sadly, though, you never get far enough before the problems of the game rear their ugly head. Missing texture render walls invisible. Enemies with so hugely restrictive sight cones that stealth requires no actual work. Clunky menu design and overdesigned stamina system that has mechanics to it but never actually utilizes them at all. Not to mention the dirth of graphics options and the fact that the keybindings were patched in day one as an afterthought. 

I really wanted and in some respects still want to like Abermore, but I refunded it before 2 hours were up. The game, more than anything is a test of your paitence, constantly wearing at your ability to put up with bugs until you finally crack.
