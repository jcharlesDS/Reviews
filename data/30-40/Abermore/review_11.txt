Note : 👎

This game had so much potential but its nothing like it really said it was.

The level design is broken and can softlock you
The story constantly lore dumps and you cant skip unless you wanna spam spacebar
and lastly the bugs are game breaking.

The worst part is the group that made the game has split into different products so chances are there isn't much left hope wise for this game.
