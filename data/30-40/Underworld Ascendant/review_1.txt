This game seems like it was drafted in 1996 and finally put on paper in 2010. The world is full of open seems, BSP's that show the empty space in between, and it just over all feels like someones 3rd game in unity. The forced bloom strains my eyes, and the over all look seems like they were all based off unity assets. I purchased heavily discounted at around 8 dollars... but even that feels like too much for this. I will try and push through the game, but it definitely feels like a chore.
