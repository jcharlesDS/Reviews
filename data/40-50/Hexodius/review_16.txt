A decent arcade-style twin-stick shooter with some light RPG elements, namely being able to choose your power-ups/support items before each stage and map exploration/clearing making up the game's story mode. There is also an arcade mode with 6 stages to unlock.
Simple but solid gameplay although the robot voice that guides you through the game gets annoying quickly. If you don't have a twin-analog stick controller get one before playing or the game likely will be unplayable.
A fine game for what it is/was although I would wait for a sale-I got it for $2.50 and at that price it's more than worth it. At full price ($10) it's not bad but so far it's a $7-8 game as the main story can probably be beaten in 5-10 hours if that much.
