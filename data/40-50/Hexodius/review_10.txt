Note : 👍

Better than expected game best played in small doses. 

Pro:
- Easy to get into twin stick shooter action. Quite traditional action with powerups and what not. 
- Fun bosses. Some even challenge you. 

Con: 
- Early game is SLEEPY BORING and the main reason why so few get far into the game. It does get better though. By the time you reach second boss the amount of toys available increases and you also have to start planning on how to both make money and spend it wisely
