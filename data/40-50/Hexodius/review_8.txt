Hexodius is an old arcade twin stick shooter. In my opinion is this game only playable with a controller. The graphics aren't that great, but what do you expect from an indie game dating back to 2013. That's not a valid argument to give this game a negative rating as plenty others did.

The game starts slow and easy, but once you progress further it gets rather challenging quickly. I never bored myself because more and more smart enemies with complex patterns jump in the levels. All in all, it's not as sleek as for example a Geometry Wars 3 which I played a while ago, but it's not that terrible either. Consider this a good game if you really like the twin stick shooter arcade games. Recommended!
