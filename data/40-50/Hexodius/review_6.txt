Not a bad little twin stick shooter...but definitely has some things going against it. The worst thing is probably the limited fov, and sometimes the bottom hud can obstruct enemies too. There's also no makers on the side of the screen to indicate where enemies are off screen. I also disliked how you only get 3 upgrade slots, there needs to be more!

Regarding the upgrade slots, you can only have 3 equipped, but when there's bigger and stronger bullets, faster shoot rate and a larger magnet to attract the shards it kinda makes those essential in my opinion. You can mix and match at any time which is great though. 

The overworld map is pretty cool too. You can go to the levels you want, (mostly) which is nice. 

Bosses are all fun, but man...they are really spongey. The story is predictable too but that's not a big deal to me.
