I don't understand all the negative reviews. The game runs well on Win10 with an Xbox 360 controller and I haven't found more than one spelling error in the many German text outputs yet. Every ordinary newspaper has more of those on one page! Only my thumbs hurt after playing one hour and trying the very demanding levels over and over again. ;-)
