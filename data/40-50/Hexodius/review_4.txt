Hexodius manages to make the twin-stick shooter formula crushingly boring by adding "exploration" and score attack elements, and that takes some skill.

In the former case, it makes the game quite grindy, as you're incentivized to complete every area in a world, which means finishing approximately 100 fairly-samey missions over the course of the story mode. They get more difficult as they go, but rarely all that much more interesting except for adding more and more varieties of enemies to the basic survival, defense, and target-destruction types, all of which basically come down to surviving waves of enemies until there aren't any more enemies. ...yes, even target-destruction, because rushing it will give you a bad rank while sticking around until the timer is almost out in order to kill more enemies will give you a high rank.

In the latter case, each map is scored, and the coveted A (or S) rank requires a high score. Given that you want A ranks in order to have enough money to buy things in the shop, this means trying to get one on every map... which means you'll occasionally be restarting maps multiple times until you can figure out what bonus actions you can do easily and/or try to avoid getting hit for that +1500 points for a perfect run.

The bosses are interesting and probably the best part of the game, but several of them are just frustrating, and I ended up accepting a D rank against the final boss because it seems to have significantly more brutal scoring than the entire rest of the game. Still managed an A or S on everything else, though.

Not recommended, either to buy it or to play it if you already have it. It's frustrating and tedious, and not even frustrating in a good way.
