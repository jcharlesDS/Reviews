    [*]Go into it on a low investment and with no expectations, and you will not be disappointed

[u]Negatives[/u]
[list]
    [*]The game is very short. It took me 7 and a half hours to complete 2 playthroughs and get all the achievements
    [*]Very limited in terms of graphics and mechanics but this is to be expected from a mobile to PC port
    [*]Not worth its regular price of $10/10€. Wait for it to go on sale for $2/2€ or buy it in a bundle with the rest of the Deus Ex games
