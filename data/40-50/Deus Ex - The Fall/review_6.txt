Permanently unfinished. It's literally one chapter. Don't buy this game, and don't worry about not having the story, this is as unconnected from the other Deus Ex games as any. You'll understand Human Revolution just fine without playing The Fall. It's a shame too, it's fun... not fun enough to be worth it, though. Only buy as part of a bundle. In fact, only when the game is on sale, AND part of a bundle.
