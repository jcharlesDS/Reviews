Wayward Manor is a puzzle game, where you play as a ghost of sorts and try to chase the inhabitants out of their gothic manor.
It is also very much a mobile style game: you need to get six "scares" per level, and you get more options to interact with the room as you scare the person or persons more times.
Each level also has three optional objectives to get.

There is therefore replay value if you want a perfect run. The characters each have a distinct personality which makes them unique, and what ties the individual levels together is a short story written for this game by none other than Neil Gaiman.

As for the graphical style: it is based on drawings from the Victorian age, such as used in the original publications of Alice in Wonderland. This means superdeformed yet "cute".

The game is easy to get through, but can be really challenging if you want to perfect it.

It's not a perfect game, I encountered a few minor glitches, but none of those really detract from playing. But my overall experience is a very positive one.
