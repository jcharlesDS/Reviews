Wow this is terrible. I am such a huge Neil Gaiman fan that even when I read other reviews marking this as terrible I bought it anyway. I'm not sure what happened here. How did they make such an insufferable game? I made it through exactly 17 painful minutes of repeatedly clicking on the same highlighted ghostable items in a room listening to the same annoying sound effects over and over in order to slowly fill up a scare bar made of skulls so that it would beat that level before utterly giving up on this game. I wish steam had a refund policy. This could have been a sandwich or a terry pratchett novel. I wasted this $10. Don't do like I did. You could just open a screenshot of the game, put on a halloween music playlist, and click on one spot of the image for 10 minutes and imagine yourself to have beat that level instead of playing this game. It would be as interesting and less annoying.
