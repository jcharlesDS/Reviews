I'd love to recommend this, being a big Neil Gaiman fan, as well as a gothic comedy/horror fan, but this just doesn't do Neil justice. The plotting is there, and the idea is great but it feels like a mobile click-fest you can just snore through. I think Neil would've been better colaborating with Double Fine or Ron Gilbert. There's an ufortunate 'cheapness' that whiffs off this game in several areas. Example: A butler walking around lighting candles with an animated flame,  which are clearly already lit with a static flame graphic.

I was honestly expecting more. I thought we were going to have a house to explore, as the enemies ran from room to room of their own accord in various combinations. This is like the 3G mobile version of what the game should've been. Sad for Neil, sad I backed it.
