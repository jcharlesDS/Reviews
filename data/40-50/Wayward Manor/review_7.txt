I wasn't impressed with this game from The Odd Gentleman and Neil Gaiman. It seems to me if you're going to make a game with Neil Gaiman, you want to take advantage of Neil Gaiman's story-telling and character-creating expertise. A puzzle style game, which is what they made with Wayward Manor, is not a good vehicle for a great story and characters, in my opinion. I was hoping Wayward Manor was going to be more like an adventure game, where plot and character would have an opportunity to shine. Based on this game, I'm fearful of what The Odd Gentlemen are going to do to the classic King's Quest series. Their website says they "strive to become masters of the short form gaming experience." Short form? Is that another way of describing mobile gaming?
