Note : 👎

I am one of those "more than 3000 fans" who backed this game when it was first announced. I've read all the books by Neil Gaiman, and I own most of them. He has been one of my top ten authors for nearly 20 years. Of course I backed this game.

I played for 38 minutes, then I couldn't take anymore. The gameplay is mindnumbing. The puzzles are repetetive. Maybe the story is really good? I have no idea. When I gave up, it was still just a bunch of cryptic flavour that will probably be really meaningful and engaging in the end when it all comes together, but doesn't make much sense until then.

After I gave up I vaccuumed my whole house. It was a more fun.
