Horrible game. I backed it up on Kickstarter and it was a huge disappointment and they're selling it for more than it's actually worth. Neil Gaiman backed it up because it really looked promising on Kickstarter. I expected better from them. The bugs, sounds effects, and game design itself reminds me of the horrible ROM games of the 1990's but Barbie did a better job of entertaining me. Huge amount of bugs, I couldn't get passed Chapter 2 level 2
