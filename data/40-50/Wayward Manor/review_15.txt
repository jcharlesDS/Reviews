I bought this game because I like Neil Gaiman a lot and he sounded confident that it would be a decent game, even if only for the story. As a long time fan, it sucks to feel this way, but I'm seriously disapointed that he would endorse/cooperatively release this garbage that's calling itself a game... The story is terrible if there is one at all, the click to activate controls are super buggy and unresponsive, and most importantly its not at all fun... I'm sorry, but the 10 bucks I paid in the kickstarter is probably $9.75 more than it was worth to me to see how a Neil Gaiman game turned out.
