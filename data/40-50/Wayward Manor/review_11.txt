I've been reading some bad reviews of this game, I think written by people who expected something different from what they got. It's a relatively short but cute, enjoyable point-and-click puzzle game. You play a ghost, who can make items in his house move in order to scare the residents. By clicking the items in the right combinations and at the right times, you are able to construct elaborate scares that will eventually cause your unwelcome houseguests to leave. The puzzles are rarely that difficult, but they can be tricky if you don't use a little imagination. I especially enjoyed harassing the old man with a crossbow, making him shoot arrows into people's butts and set things on fire.  It has an intro from Neil Gaiman and the art direction looks like something he would design, but don't buy this game solely on the Neil Gaiman name. Buy it if you like a clever family-friendly, puzzle game with some replay value and a unique art style.
