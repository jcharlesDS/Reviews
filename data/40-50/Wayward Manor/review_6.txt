Note : 👎

The good: Occasionally challenging puzzles, particularly if you're an achievement hunter. Cute art style and some fun bits of narration. 

The bad: Controls are clunky. Music and sound effects get very repetitive. Some of the achievements appear to be broken. Game got a bit grind-y feeling by the end. While the art style/direction was cool, the execution is poor.

General info: I became interested in Wayward Manor (like many, I suspect) because Neil Gaiman was attached to the project. His writing gives a few fun moments and snide comments, but it definitely gets pushed to the rear in favor of the gameplay, such as it is. When I heard Gaiman was helping with this game, I assumed it would be heavy on the narrative with thrills and chills; this definitely seems like a children's game. The whole thing is just very simplistic. I really, really wanted to like this game, but I'm just not feeling it. This game had a lot of potential and I can't help but think they wasted it. 

Overall: Probably wouldn't recommend this unless you're some kind of Neil Gaiman completionist.
