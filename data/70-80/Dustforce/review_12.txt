Note : 👍

ATTENTION: I recommend this game only for masochistic peoples!!! The muscis are very good and calm, animation is good too also a gameplay. In fact nearly all is perfect except the difficulty..... I completed 42 levels on 64 but I prefer to stop here before I break my stick. I'm not a nervous person in general except for this game. You have been adviced ;)
