This is a mostly competent metroidvania with a satisfying Yggdrasil skill tree (which uses gold dropped by enemies), satisfying traversal and movement mechanics (WAY superior to Hollow Knight in this regard), and mostly fluid and satisfying combat.

It is weakened by its over-reliance on horde mechanics, which introduce difficulty by overwhelming you with on-screen spam. I'm not a fan of this design philosophy, and I especially didn't appreciate it during some of the boss fights, especially the final one, which might be the most unfun boss fight I have ever experienced. I watched a pro doing it on YouTube and still hated it. This isn't a difficulty or skill issue: I could fight this boss with an invincibility cheat and hate it no less. Being blown all over the screen while trying to use the unreliable grappling hook to get back to the boss's damageable node never felt like my skill was being tested. Only my patience.

I really enjoyed most of my time spent on this game, but the times I didn't enjoy it I REALLY didn't enjoy it, and that is relevant too. There is a lot to love about this game, but I would not recommend it to a friend.
