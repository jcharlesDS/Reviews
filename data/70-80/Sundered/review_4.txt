grind grind grind. if i want grind then i would play some mmo. what's progress even about in this game? developing some real skills? constant spam of horde of mobs do not show nothing. What is point of those horde?! if im close to finnish those mobs then another wave's appear and over and over, even when i fight with bosses those show up wtf?! poinless waves, pointless game
