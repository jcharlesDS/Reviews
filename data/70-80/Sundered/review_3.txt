8/10. Very fun albeit short game. I love the lovcraftian elements! I wasn't sure how well the medtroivania rouge like combo would work but they do it very well. Takes about 12 hours to beat, but there are 3 endings so its worth a replay or 2. definitely recommend if you have a rouge-like addiction like me! :D
