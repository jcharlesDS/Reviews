Another unfair powerspike. I think I’m done.
Level 1: Okay, maybe decent.
Level 2: Suddenly everything has more HP, nasty debuffs, and absurd damage output.

The difficulty spike is not fun – it’s frustrating and feels unbalanced. Instead of a fair challenge, you get punished. I wanted progression, not punishment.

Honestly? I'm tired. Games should be exciting, not demoralizing. This one just reminded me why gaming doesn’t feel rewarding anymore.

Uninstalled. Trying to get my money back.
