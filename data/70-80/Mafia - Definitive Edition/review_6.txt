Honestly, i am a bit disappointed.

I figured i couldn't play full screen, but it worked on window mode.

The thing is, i didn't feel like I played that much... The missions could have been a little longer, or the map could have been explored. I found the controls difficult, and not always responsive.

However, the scenario, the story, and the atmosphere were nice.
