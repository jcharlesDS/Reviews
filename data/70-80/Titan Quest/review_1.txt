What's left to be said about this classic and yet modern(ish) game? I love it!

Sure I could go on and on about the fun mythology here. I could talk about the story. I could say how interesting the voices and accepts are. I could even talk about this cool spear I have. But instead I'll just say "Play this great ARPG because even after all this time it's still great!"

Although if there were a few extra QOL tweaks I wouldn't be mad.
