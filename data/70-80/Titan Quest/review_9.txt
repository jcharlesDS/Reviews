What to say about this masterpiece?

I played this game as a kid and it was basically my childhood. It's incredible that I've only just now discovered that Titan Quest is available for purchase on Steam and has been around for almost a decade.

I immediately bought it expecting to reminisce, but I'll probably turn it off immediately due to the outdated game mechanics, but what didn't happen..... I finished the first location and then bought all the DLCs and have so far sunk fifteen hours into it, it's amazing how timeless this game is... Oh my god, this is going to be a wild ride!

Worth every penny!
