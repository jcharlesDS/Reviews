Fun fact: when this game was first released, it was generally seen by many of us as a diablo-clone that would tide us over until the real deal (i.e the next Diablo game) was released. Well, Diablo 3 came and went. And then Diablo Immortal and Diablo 4.  And as it turns out, this stop gap "diablo clone" was anything but second rate. We had the real deal all along and didn't even know it. Because not only was Titan Quest awesome back in the day, it's better now than it's ever been and it's far superior to anything Diablo has going for it. And now it's not the next Diablo that everyone is waiting for...it's Titan Quest II. So are we now playing Diablo while waiting for the next Titan Quest, similar to how we played Titan Quest waiting for the next Diablo? Oh hell no. We are playing Titan Quest, silly.
