I would 100% recommend this game a pure 10/10. Even though the game crashes every 2 hours or so for my brother and I when doing multiplayer we just load it up and continue. Amazing game even when we have over 100 deaths in the first act, it's insanely fun and feels like the good old days of janky but fun RPGs
