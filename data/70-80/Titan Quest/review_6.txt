TL:DR Its good fun

In this game you play as John(or johanne) Titanquest in their quest to go to town on anything that dare mess with humanity! More seriously thought its an old H&S with what some peoples would call "archaic design" but also without a lot of the modern trappings that have been bogging down the genre since Diablo 3 hit the shelves.

 Its pure "hold the left click on the direction of the bad guys" fun while also having quite some build variety with its mastery combinaisons and wide array of loot. And whats better is that you can even mod it to add brand new campaigns, new masteries(even if it seems like they have to take the place of already existing ones) or just tweak the balancing a wee bit to your taste.

Of course its not perfect and even with all the updates and the anniversary edition it lacks quite a lot of QoL more modern games, or even its spiritual sequel made on the same engine Grim Dawn, have and the level & quest design can be a bit... odd at times, its still pretty good.

I recommend it at a sale thought because lets be honest twenty bucks WITHOUT the dlcs is way too much.
