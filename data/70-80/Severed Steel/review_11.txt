Wow! What an amazing game! It's so fun to just run around shooting people in slow motion. I love how you can do flips, too! I got this game on sale for, like, $2, and I didn't know if my computer would be able to run it. But I was proven wrong! My computer does meet the system requirements, yes, but even so, this computer can't run many fps games, so I was shocked when I was able to enjoy this masterpiece. If anyone is reading this, then trust me, this game is great, and I 100% recommend that you buy it! Get it while it's on sale!
