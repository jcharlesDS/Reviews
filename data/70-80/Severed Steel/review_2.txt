I absolutely love this game. Fast-paced, action-packed, arcade-like FPS that focuses on rewarding the player's gameplay through optimization, and trial and error.

I actually found out about this game through the Steam Discovery Queue (Ikr?) and using my all-knowing media judgement, I figured this would be worth trying out based off the clips on the store page. My first reaction to this was that I was playing as a modernized, gun-wielding 2B that was out for some serious revenge. Therefore, I played it tactically at first with some stylized executions. But then after playing a lot more, I refined my judgement to now think that is this a mix between Quake (1996) and Superhot (2016). Overall, I think that is an accurate assessment. Whatever the case is, this game is very fun.

The only negative criticism that is immediately apparent to me is the fact that, for whichever reason, sometimes I cannot shoot enemies after performing a series of actions (sliding, diving, picking up a new weapon). I don't know if that is a bug or a feature, but it is very annoying to encounter, especially when I'm about to die and I need a kill. It can end a long run very quickly.

In conclusion, you can definitely trust Greylock Studio to deliver a promising FPS title. These are the types of games that you can play endlessly without it ever feeling like a grind. Because that's exactly how arcade games work. You play it to take a load off, turn off your brain for a bit, then quit playing 30 minutes to an hour later. Very healthy.
