Not that I would ever do this, but Severed Steel is a phenomenal game for when you just need to perk yourself up while working from home or doing chores, you can load it up and shoot people in the face within a minute, and levels are short and sweet so you can just dip in, get your fix and then get back to doing whatever you were doing.

The gunplay is fast and fun without being overcomplicated, and the slo-mo is generous enough for you to really have that sensation of playing max payne or a matrix style game like the specialists (shoutouts if you remember that one)
