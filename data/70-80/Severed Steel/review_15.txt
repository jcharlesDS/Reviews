good, but could've been great with small tweak around the AI. 

first please made it so AI can climb the crater i've made with railgun. i don't like cheesing the AI when they stuck in the crater.

second please add aggresive enemy mutator, since you can't really aggro them and hunting them 1 by 1 in firefight is annoying especially the last 10 of them.
