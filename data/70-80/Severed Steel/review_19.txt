If you like chaotic shooters, then this will be a good game for you. It's a simple game that utilizes time slows to make the levels even beatable, but I feel it works very well. The game teaches you to rely on the time slow, but not enough to make it impossible to play without it. Every kill you get without the time slow feels really rewarding. The main campaign is short but there is a good amount of extra content.
