got this for the same price as a can of redbull and regret nothing.
this has 1 of the best soundtracks I've heard on a game its banger after banger. I really enjoy the combat and the movement allowing you to pull off some dirty skillshots. it plays a bit like trepang 2 but with better mobility and an arm amputation with a built in cannon
