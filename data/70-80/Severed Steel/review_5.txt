I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Great game its a steal for the $2.49 right now. i spent a hour and a half playing it and it felt like a minute. i thoght going into this game "This is probably going to take me a while to get good at " i will say its definitely fast paced but there are difficulty setting and a slow mo button when you panic but once you get used to it you don't use slow mo as much. hope this helps you decide on if you buy also i barely post reviews but i felt like doing it on this one!
