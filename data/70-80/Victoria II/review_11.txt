unplayable in 2025.  Tried the tutorial to refresh my understanding of the game play and it repeatedly crashes to desktop over and over just trying simple things like moving a ship or landing an army. I cannot recommend this and give it a thumbs down.  Do not buy it is like fruit left rotting in the sun.  Tasty when fresh but now will just make you sick.

If you do decide to buy, I suggest trying immediately and keeping you time to under what is needed for a refund.
