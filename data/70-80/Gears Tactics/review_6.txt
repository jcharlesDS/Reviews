Overall, very fun turn based tactics game a la XCOM. It carriers over the cinematic and character driven story telling from the Gears shooters series. After a while, you notice that the levels keep repeating a lot and variety is lacking. The combat remains fun, though the mandatory side missions feel like filler to pad the game length.
