At first I thought this would be just pointless spin-off without much thought, but in the end I got a great X-COM like strategy game. The mechanics are fun and intuitive, shooting or chainsawing locusts is great as always, even in strategic view and element. The graphics are awesome as well, cutscenes are as good as mainline games. Surprisingly good.
