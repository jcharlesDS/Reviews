Gears Tactics: If XCOM and Gears of War Had a Baby That Didn’t Skip Arm Day

Review:

Alright, so here’s the deal. Gears Tactics is like if XCOM and Gears of War got together, had a couple of drinks, and woke up to realize they’d just made the most brutal, turn-based lovechild in tactical gaming history. And you know what? It’s glorious.

You take command of a squad of gritty, no-nonsense soldiers who have zero time for subtlety. These aren’t your average, soft-spoken tacticians who make decisions with a clipboard and a coffee in hand. Nope. These are the kinds of people who solve problems by shooting, chainsawing, and stomping on whatever stands between them and victory. If you're here for diplomacy, look elsewhere—this is about getting the job done and leaving a trail of Locusts in your wake.

The Combat: Imagine XCOM, but instead of fighting against aliens, you're dealing with mutated monsters that are constantly trying to eat you and act like they have a serious beef with humanity. Your squad of hardened soldiers is tasked with cutting through waves of enemies with as much grace as a sledgehammer to the face. Tactical combat is all about taking cover, using your abilities strategically, and giving the Locusts a one-way ticket to their own personal hell.

Oh, and let's not forget the chainsaw bayonet. Every time you get a close kill with it, you can practically hear the game whispering, “You’re a badass” as you saw through enemies like they’re made of wet cardboard. Nothing screams tactical genius more than a well-timed chainsaw to the face.

The Story: You play as Gabe Diaz (yeah, the Diaz family gets around), fighting back against the Locust Horde in a prequel story to the main Gears of War series. The plot isn’t exactly Shakespeare, but who needs it when you're basically playing a tactical war game where the characters scream at enemies like they’re auditioning for an action movie? The story gets the job done, but it’s the action that makes you feel like you’re living the Gears dream.

The Squad: You’ll get to assemble your squad with characters that each have their own abilities—some are all about blowing stuff up, others are keen on healing and supporting the team. But let’s be real: it doesn’t matter what their abilities are when you can chainsaw an enemy into oblivion. But hey, it’s nice to have some extra firepower when things get dicey.

Each character has personality, too. These are not your stereotypical "just-following-orders" soldiers. They’ve got issues. They’ve got attitudes. And they definitely have trust issues—mainly because they’re surrounded by a hellscape of monsters that are, quite frankly, not interested in playing nice. If you’re here for a squad that’s all business with a side of "don’t mess with us," you’ll love this squad.

The Strategy: Gears Tactics might be turn-based, but there’s nothing slow about it. You’ll be constantly on your toes, figuring out your next move, positioning, and praying that your soldier doesn’t get shredded by the nearest enemy that decides to pop out from behind cover. It’s not a game that lets you sit back and relax. No, it’s more of a game where you grit your teeth, plan your moves, and then smash the button for maximum carnage. The tension is real, the stakes are high, and the explosions? Oh, the explosions are beautiful.

Final Thoughts: Gears Tactics is a perfect blend of strategic depth and chaotic action. If you’re looking for a game where you can show off your tactical brilliance while absolutely wrecking anything that stands in your way, this is the one. It’s XCOM with biceps. It’s Gears of War with a strategic twist. It’s chainsawing your enemies while strategizing your next brutal move. And, most importantly, it’s fun. If you don’t like tactical strategy with a side of "let’s make this a bloodbath," then this game probably isn’t for you.

But if you like to destroy, explode, and leave a bloody trail behind you? Welcome to the squad. Grab your chainsaw, gear up, and let’s show these Locusts that tactics means nothing when you’ve got enough firepower to make a tank look like a Nerf gun.
