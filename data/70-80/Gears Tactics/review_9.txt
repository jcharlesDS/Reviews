Overall, it's an enjoyable game. While it might not be quite as deep as the Xcom games, it makes a lot of worthwhile improvements to the formula: using your actions in any order you want, multiple overwatch shots per action point remaining, pretty deep skill tree, and more. It also does a good job organically incentivising aggressive tactics with the executions. It's worth playing if you like tactics games, and either have, or don't mind making an xbox account.
