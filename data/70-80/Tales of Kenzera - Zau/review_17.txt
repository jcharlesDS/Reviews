Note : 👍

Simple and short Metroidvania with good movement, graphics, story and music.
Movement provides a good sense of speed and flow.
Combat needs more variety and mask balance needs tuning. Blue mask is much more useful than red.
Played mostly on Steam Deck at 45 FPS with Steam Deck preset and XeSS Balanced.
