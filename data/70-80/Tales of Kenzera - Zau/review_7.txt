I have a few issues with this game, but most of them are minor. Even though it is a Metroidvania, there really isn't much backtracking too it, which I believe to be a very important part of the genre. When you reach a new area, you can finish that area before going to the next. There is no system for marking something on the map to check out again later. Also the performance is kinda bad for how the game looks, on Steam Deck I had plenty of FPS drops and eventually settled in on a 40fps cap just to keep it from dropping in random spots.

With all that said, the meat and potatoes of this game is not the actually moment to moment gameplay or deep exploration and discovery. Instead, this game is more about the characters and dealing with loss. I knew this going into it, and I was not disappointed. Having lost my father not long ago, I knew this game would hit me in the feels. And it did. But it was a wonderful experience and I definitely recommend the game.
