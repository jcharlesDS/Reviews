I came back to this game some time after they introduced Story mode, which is supposed to be more relaxed than Relaxed mode. But there is still a LOT of difficult, fast-paced fighting in it, which is very disappointing. Why do game developers put so much focus on violence and combat? Why can't we just explore, find things, talk with people and uncover the story without being forced to stop every few seconds to battle it out with fast moving enemies? I want to experience the Metroidvania side of the game but you're making me play Street Fighter. No thanks!
