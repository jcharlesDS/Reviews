I have just finished the game with all 19 achievements, and have enjoyed it almost 100%. There were two or three very small things that bugged me: by the end of the game, many abilities were tied to similar keys, and in the last chaise sequence I died. So many times. Simply because I forgot to press LT first for example. Unsure if there is even a solution for that, but it got a bit frustrating in the end, because I just couldn't get into the rhythm of the jumping. Similarly, sometimes not being able to see where I'm supposed to land because the camera moved in a very specific way killed me and that felt kind of. Like forcing death and repeat just to see the next part of the level / be prepared the next time. Last thing, I'm not sure if I liked the very last boss fight. It was fun but it kind of ruined an emotional moment for me just a bit. 

Over all, however, it is a beautiful game, I spent a lot of time looking at the background scenery, I enjoyed looking for all the collectables, the platforming was fun, and the story made me cry at one point, so, 9.5 out of 10. Would probably play again if I could just jump around using the abilities.
