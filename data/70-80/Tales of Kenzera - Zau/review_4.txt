I wish I could give this game more of an unqualified recommendation, because all of the art surrounding the game is impeccable. The story is well-told, the visuals and soundtrack are beautiful, and all the vocal performances are fantastic.

My big issue is with how this game plays. The combat feels good at first, but as more and more encounters pile on towards the latter half of the game and I start having to navigate enemies, traversal, and instant death traps all at once, the controls start to feel floaty, imprecise, and not altogether up to the task of sustaining even a game this short. Upgrades to each ability path feel insubstantial, the various traversal skills unlocked in each area feel too specialized to be exciting, and the last third of the game in particular is filled with combat rooms that lock until you fight two, three, four waves of enemies. These were perhaps my biggest annoyance by the end, as these kinds of combat rooms should be illegal on their own, but get all the more egregious when you're in a tiny arena and just manage to beat a wave of enemies, and then have a whole second and third wave spawn in when you think you're done. The repetition can get discouraging.

That said, I'm going to recommend this game regardless because the art and world are fascinating and unique, and I do hope this developer gets another shot at a game in this universe, where hopefully they learn to be much more intentional about the combat they decide to include, or even just get rid of it altogether. No game this short should have this many trash mobs, but even beyond that, a world this interesting could be so much better explored through means other than combat. Put more of a focus on traversal, solving problems, meeting interesting characters, and let your game and universe grow into its full potential rather than flounder against the creative limits of exploration through violence.
