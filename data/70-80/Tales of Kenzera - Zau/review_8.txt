TLDR:   amazing story, 10/10, will play again

Tales of Kenzera: Zau is a fantastic game.  It's not very long (I have completed the game at 100% in only 9 hours), but what it manages to do in such a short time is remarkable.  The story is really good, and well written.  The characters are also very well written.  There are only a few, but they all add something to the story. Mechanically, Tales of Kenzera: Zau doesn't do very much to push the envelope among metroidvania style platformers, but it doesn't need to with a well written world and characters. The game is not too difficult (at least on normal) and has a robust fast travel system, so you can get where you need to go, usually without too much backtracking. even when you die, it is very forgiving (again at least on normal).  I highly recommend this game to both seasoned players and those new to platformers as well as those who enjoy a good single player experience.
