Fun platforming game action game, reminded me of PS classics I grew up on. Wait till it is on sale though IMO, like I did, at about 10 hours for me, and that was taking my time with it, I don't feel it's worth more than 5-10 dollars. If the gameplay was more smooth, and combat was slightly more engaging it would be worth it's original price. What it lacks in execution, it makes up for in heart and nostalgia for a small price, to those who enjoy the games that inspired it or just a simple spooky platforming game that can be beat in 5-10 hours depending on your skill and devotion to collecting everything.
