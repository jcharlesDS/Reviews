This game was very disappointing imo. The idea of a platformer/hack and slash hybrid where you play as the halloween mascot stingy jack seemed to be 100% my shit. Unfortunately these 2 genres mixing together meant that neither had any room to be fleshed out or explored. The platforming is extremely basic and the hack and slash gameplay is extremely simple and doesn't leave much in the way for combos or differing tactics. The boss fights were pretty good, the atmosphere is jaw dropping and the music ain't bad but the gameplay has a long way to go before it can be truly captivating. Maybe in a future sequel the developers can deepen the mechanics just a little bit. 4/10
