Bring's back that PS1 feeling with a new age feel. Take's you back to the days of Medieval and Pandemonium (Remember those gems?) with the same sort of platforming and enemy smashing. Plenty of collectables and mini games built into the core game play loop making this a must play for anyone seeking that nostalgia trip with plenty of pop references along the way and hilarious voice grunts bringing more of that pre voice acting audio.  Another recommend from me.
