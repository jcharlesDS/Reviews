I'm a big fan of RPG games to begin with, but the world of Baldur's Gate really captivated me, and I absolutely don't regret spending €60 on this AAA title. It's totally worth it. The Dungeons & Dragons universe and this collaboration mark an important milestone in RPG history. The story offers an incredible amount of possibilities in terms of gameplay quality.

By the time I reached Act 3, I would have appreciated a reputation system in the city with more interactions with NPCs that could trigger various events. But Baldur's Gate doesn't lie to us — we follow a storyline throughout the game, and our choices influence both the beginning and the end.

I had a lot of laughs and surprises — 10/10.
