Yes, but be warned. This is a puzzle game that is more than just a fun little perspective shifting platformer. That's what I thought I was buying. What I got instead is a puzzle game involving linguistics, secret codes, and headaches. Still a great game, just not as relaxed as I thought I'd be, haha.
