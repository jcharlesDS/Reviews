Solving puzzles with the power of three dimensions.

You play as Gomez, a marshmellow-like being who's eyes just got opened to the power of 3D. He then goes on a grand journey to collect cubes by completing puzzles; and the game has a lot of puzzles.... many of which make no sense when you first see them. The world can also get pretty overwhelming, with the number of puzzles/secrets you don't know how to solve racking up quickly at the start of the game. That said, once you figure out the flow of things it's just some good puzzle-solving fun.
