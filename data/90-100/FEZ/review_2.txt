FEZ is one of the most unique gaming experiences I have ever had. I don't really know how to describe it, but the world of FEZ absolutely mesmerizes me. It starts really simple as a platformer/collecting game, but as soon as you figure out how to read the languages in the game, it becomes something truly unhinged.

Also, this game has one of the best soundtracks and sound design I have ever heard, kudos to Disasterpeace for the soundtrack!
