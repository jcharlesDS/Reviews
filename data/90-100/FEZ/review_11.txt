I think Fez was so well received because it released back when indie games weren't really hitting their stride yet. That combined with a bit of a neat gimmick made for a game that was really enticing about ten years ago. Unfortunately, while the game holds up fine, it doesn't really feel special anymore. The gimmick is cool, but the puzzles just aren't deep or interesting enough to keep the game going for more than an hour or two and, sadly, that's longer than it takes to finish the game. It quickly gets stale and once it is, it stops being worth playing.
