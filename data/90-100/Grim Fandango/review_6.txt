Surprised I didn't write one already.
TLDR: This is one of those point-and-click (kinda) games where the solution to a puzzle is: "Put the shoe on top of the door to unlock it".
It doesn't get quite that bad, but by god does it feel that way. 
At some point, the gameplay is so slow and meandering, that without a guide, you are more likely to waste time than you are to experience any form of joy from back tracking back and forth between points to shuttle items and click on characters, in a very particular order, to progress through the game.

The story itself is interesting, as well as the world itself. But because the gameplay is such a bore, I couldn't finish it.
(And this comes from someone who enjoys Point and Click games, as well as puzzle games, to some degree.)
