Goofy point and click adventure game with good humour. Art style is very fitting. Story and characters are well written. Many Calavera is very relatable and it is nice to see his development through out the game. At the very end, the feeling of completing your journey really hits you. Game has two problems though. One is bugs there are tons visual and gameplay bugs. You can easily get locked out of progressing. Be sure to save your game very frequently. The other is some puzzles are really cryptic and because of the bugs sometimes you think what you tried was wrong but it was actually the right way.
