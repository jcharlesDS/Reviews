Grim Fandango Remastered is a gem - charming, witty, and soaked in that unmistakable LucasArts vibe. The humor is top-tier, the kind of quirky, clever writing that makes you grin even when you're stuck on a puzzle for an hour. Manny Calavera is an absolute legend, and the worldbuilding? Pure Day of the Dead noir magic.

The story is genuinely interesting, filled with weird yet lovable characters and plot twists that keep you curious the whole way through. It’s like a detective story set in the afterlife, but with more jazz and more skeletons.

Now, the puzzles… yeah. Let’s be real. They're often deeply unintuitive. The kind where you try using a rubber chicken on a forklift and suddenly you’ve solved the mystery of life. This is one of those games where having a guide handy is less cheating and more self-care.

Still, despite the brain-melting puzzle logic, it’s absolutely worth the ride. The remaster brings a nice visual polish and that gorgeous re-orchestrated soundtrack, which makes wandering the Land of the Dead even more enjoyable.

A must-play classic. Just don’t feel bad when you alt-tab to a walkthrough. Everyone does it.
