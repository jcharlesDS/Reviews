one of very unique game that I ever played. I've already finished this game more than 10 years ago. but I just bought on steam for pay a respect. and wanted to kept the connections with this game and reminiscing the whole good memories back then. that specific day of the dead vibe, flowers, romance, noir and witty. this game influenced me in a lot.
