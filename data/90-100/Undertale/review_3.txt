I pirated this game and played through it multiple times in 2015/2016 when I was still in High School but I gifted the game full price to one of my closets friends. Now over a decade later they gifted it back to me and I was able to play it again but legally. This game still holds up and it has endearing characters, a fun story, amazing music, neat Easter eggs, and a lot more. 
Over 10 years later and Undertale is still one of my favorite indie games. Toby Fox is also really based for being a Touhou fan too, one of the biggest reasons why I was interested in Undertale
