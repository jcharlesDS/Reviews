Not the most engaging from purely gameplay perspective, but the lore, characters, music, artstyle and storytelling more than make up for it. The game has multiple endings, changing to the player's preferred playstyle. The game overall has a great way of telling the message: "It's okay to not solve everything through violence".

The game is getting close to 10 years old by now, and the characters, music and plot are still as amazing as it was in 2015.
