I heard all these good things about this game. I heard that its a "must play" for everyone and that its the greatest game of all time. So one day, I bought the game and played it. Then I stopped playing. I was like "oh. This isnt fun to me". I didnt know why I didnt like it and how to fix it. Why did so many people like this game and why could I not enjoy any second of it?
I later realized that it wasnt my fault. It wasnt the games fault either though; undertale just isnt my type of game. Thats completely fine though!
