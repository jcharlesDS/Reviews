Undertale is an amazing darling indie title. Its story is truly one of the best that I have seen portrayed in a video game. I highly suggest going into this game blind, or knowing the bare minimum, as it adds to the experience. Every character is written well, and the whole game is genuinely a masterpiece. This is one of the best video games I’ve ever played, and I would recommend to anyone who loves classic styled games, RPGs, and even platformers.
