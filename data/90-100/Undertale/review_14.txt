I'm pretty sure millions of people have already said what I'm going to say in this review, but Undertale deserves all the praise it gets. The fantastic music, unique combat style, compelling story, and memorable characters make it one of the best games I've ever played! If you're like I was before I wrote this review and haven't played it in the almost 10 years it's been out (happy anniversary by the way), I highly recommend doing so. Toby Fox, if you're reading this... hi ^-^
