I held my 100th review for this game specifically.

This game means everything to me and has been a major influence on who I am as a person.  
I originally played Undertale in 2016, but I was pretty young and didn’t understand English at the time.  

Coming back to it recently, it was nothing but pure nostalgia. Everything about it was amazing, and the endings were deeply emotional (the True Pacifist ending had me crying a little bit).  

Thank you Toby Fox, for creating this masterpiece. You inspire me alot.
