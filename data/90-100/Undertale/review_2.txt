As a kid born with Devil May Cry, GTA, Resident Evil, and God of War, I never thought that text-based games like Undertale would be my kind of game. The simple graphics and heavy focus on story didn’t appeal to me at all. Plus, my English wasn’t great at the time, so I had no interest in trying it.

But eventually, many years later, I gave it a shot. And at first, I hated it; sorry about that, but for me, there was too much dialogue, which is technically still acceptable if most of the dialogue did not feel unnecessary and didn’t seem to affect the story. 

To clarify, if you're the type of person who loves diving deep into character backstories (such as learning about their favorite foods), you'll probably enjoy this aspect. But if you are that type of people who don't give a damn about other people's business (like me), sitting through their stories feels like pure torture as every time they open up, I will be like, “I don’t freakin care about what food you like to eat or what sport you prefer to watch, just tell me how to get the hell out of this damn place!”

However, as I played more, I realized that these little conversations gave the characters real personality, making the world feel alive rather than dull. This is when the magic begins; the more you play, the closer you get to each character. But still, if you really don't care about them, it's just putting useless information into your brain.

The combat was another surprise. It looked like a bunch of mini-games, but it actually required skill and attention. The game balanced story, dialogue, and gameplay better than I expected.

Still, I found it a bit too simplistic for my taste. The game relies heavily on reading, so this might not be for you if you’re not a fan of lengthy dialogues. 

Relying on reading is one thing, but the worst part is that stories lacked major twists or surprises, making the overall experience feel predictable, resulting in whatever you read becoming unnecessary information. I know this game has multiple endings, but that's not the point. The real issue is how predictable it is—"kill = bad" is way too simple. Games like Fallout or Elder Scrolls do it better, where choices aren’t clearly right or wrong, just shades of gray. Your actions don’t always lead to expected outcomes, and there’s no moral scoreboard judging you.

While it wasn’t my favorite, I can see why people love it—it’s unique, charming, and different from most games I’ve played.
