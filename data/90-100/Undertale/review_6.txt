Beautiful. This was my first time playing the game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters are well written. They made me laugh, they made me cry, they truly captivated me. The music for the game is probably some of the best I've ever heard, and listening to a lot of the most popular tracks in game after hearing them in videos and content all over social media was very satisfying. And the story...oh my goodness...it broke my heart and then just as easily put it back together. I regret not being able to play this way sooner, and I won't lie, I had some negative opinions about the game at first, but I'm very glad I gave it an honest chance. This will stick with me for years to come. 10/10 <3
