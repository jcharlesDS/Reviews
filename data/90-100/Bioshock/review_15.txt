Just started playing the original BioShock 1 on a Chromebook Acer Spin 713 with 16GB RAM and it's working great. Not as smooth as native apps, but I can play, move, watch cut scenes, and spacial sounds. It seems to have installed the "Windows" version running on this Chromebook. This is so awesome!!! This will keep me entertained in my 20hr plane ride coming soon.
