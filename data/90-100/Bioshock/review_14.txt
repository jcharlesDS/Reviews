The pc port fot this is genuinely so broken and outdated, the pipe mini game is an actual lobotomy and the combat is pretty basic and stiff. But its true what they say about Rapture. Very immersive world. It's fun just exploring every corner of this place finding little details and environmental storytelling. I would love a remake of this game one day cause this is barely playable and I hear the remaster is barely an improvement.
