Has its place in gaming history, but has a major flaw I can't overlook.
The otherwise very effective horror atmosphere is undercut by the lack of any consequences upon player death. No resources are lost, enemy health doesn't regenerate.
Game is at its best when you play it like a sandbox and don't worry about conserving your resources, as you'd think to in a survival horror.
Worth playing through at least once, especially if you haven't been spoiled.
