Note : 👍

The game is every bit incredible in atmosphere and game play; there are intricate mechanics that were thought out very well during the making of the game, and the world-building is just as good with the audio logs scattered throughout the game.

However, gun play felt very unforgiving. Unless you like accurate gun play, the shotgun feels weak at any distance other than when you're at melee range. It's very hard to get shots to hit with the machine gun, as well. I think it's just me, but I could not git gud throughout the game; I relied heavily on my powers to nerf the enemies to then mow them down. Maybe that was the intention to begin with.

Hacking everything is broken; it's the one mechanic that helped me breeze through the hardest mode.
Resources can me scarce mid-game, but you eventually run out of space near endgame.

I don't know if I'd replay this game, but for a first time experience, it was great; it lived up to the hype.

P.S. - I played Atomic Heart first, so take this critique with a grain of salt.
Addendum -- If you want atmosphere, play this game. If you want stability, play the remaster; this game likes to crash; quicksave is your best friend.
