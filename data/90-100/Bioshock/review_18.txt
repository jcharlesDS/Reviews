i was trying to all the fixes from the internet for the whole hour, for Bioshock and Bioshock Remastered. First save in the game - it crashes. It keeps crashing all the time I am trying to save the game. Awful experience for such an epic game.
If you have new system - doesn't bother yourself to download/play, even with a huge discount
