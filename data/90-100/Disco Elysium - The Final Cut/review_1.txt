Trully The best story driven game i've ever played. I don't know if any other comes even close to this.
I do no want to spoil anything,  and i think this game's reviews speak for themselves anyway.

I think i can only praise it. The art is beyond incredible, the writing is incredible, the music and voice acting are incredible, the characters and their depth is so impressive and interesting, with a world building that'll grab you whole. 

It took my 2years and a half to finish it, and you can finish it in a few days, but i loved taking my time.

This is an art masterpiece that i'll remember for a very, very long time. Tequila Sunset to you Harry. 

A Big thanks to the ORIGINAL ZA/UM team for taking the time to create such a beautifull game. 

Speaking of wich, most of the original members of the ZA/UM team were fired after a conflict with shareholders of the studio, following fraudulent actions from the same shareholers ( Ilmar Kompus & Tõnis Haavel among others ).
Fuck them. 

I would advise to not buy the game (i buyed it before all' of this happened sadly), and just go sail on other seas to play it.

 "Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself" has never been so true.
