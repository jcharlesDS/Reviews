This is one of my favorite games of all time. Built by a dream team of developers working with the best technology of the time. This game is one of the most fun jedi simulators ever made. Kyle is back and as much the badass we love and remember. The gameplay holds up even after all these years. The graphics are amazing (for the time).  Do yourself a favor, get this game and Jedi Academy. If you were to play only one game in the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, let it be this. The modability of this game (and *especially* Jedi Academy) also ensures lots of replay value.
