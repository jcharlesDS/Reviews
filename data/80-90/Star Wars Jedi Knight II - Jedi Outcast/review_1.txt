I think Jedi Academy is far better but still the game has good level designs and variety. I recommend you to play this game first, its a good preparation to next game. The story takes place before it and tells us Kyle Katarn background. It's like a raw version of Jedi Academy and gives some glimpse of its gameplay. Trust me go with this order, you will enjoy more.
