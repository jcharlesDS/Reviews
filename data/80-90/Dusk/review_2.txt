The gameplay and the setting are quite solid. Although I find sickles and mortar weak, the weapons are overall good. I don't have a past with games such as Quake or old-school DOOM but, it managed to give me the same feelings as I felt in my childhood when I was playing Counter Strike 1.6. And not just the in-game experience, it manages to give that retro vibe from the menus to the save system. Even, if you activate all the filters in the graphic settings, it is literally possible to turn it into a nineties game. And those filters are quite succesful as in general, indie games tend to exaggerate it. After beating this, I even went purchasing Quake I, II and Ultrakill. We'll see how they turn out...

The only criticism I will make is that the game becomes overkill sometimes. I mean, some bosses we beat appear as regular enemies in the upcoming chapters. Especially that Mama enemy who was already quite annoying as a boss. Or, E3M9 was a total filler as all we did was killing mobs in an arena in NINE phases and get to a 3-mob boss fight in the tenth phase. If that was what I was looking for, I would go play the Endless mode which I did...

I can absolutely recommend.
