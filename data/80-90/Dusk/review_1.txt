Pretty okay boomer shooter with unique Lovecraft/Exorcism/Texas Chain Saw theme and the retro visuals. The environments are surreal but the guns are very conventional: pistols, shotguns, rifles, submachineguns and such with really no personality. And the explosives the player has doesn't have much power. But still the game has some neat ideas, like the trampoline spots, wall climbing power-ups, switching gravity and the ability to flip when in air.
