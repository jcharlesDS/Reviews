This is a brilliantly designed boomer shooter with tons of humor, a thick atmosphere and banging soundtrack. The levels are sprawling and immensely creative with changes to scenery as you progress or the level's geometry itself beginning to fall in on itself. My only main complaint is that some of the secrets are incredibly obtuse and almost require a guide due to how hidden they are. Otherwise, 9/10 experience. Please play this game!!!
