Awesome super fast paced fps game. 
not recommend from those who suffer unknown motion sickness from game run on Doom engine.
I had to take a break every 10 minutes for like half an hours but every minutes I spent on this game. it awesome! the level design is just awesome! give it a go if you're into boomer shooter
