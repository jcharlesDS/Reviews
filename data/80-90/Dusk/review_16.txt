Probably one of the best games ive played. From the movement to the gunplay to the story, soundtrack and voice acting. It rewards exploration and mastering the movement is extremely rewarding. The creative design and character modeling in raw as hell and the enemies never get boring to look at. It seriously is worth every penny
