This is honestly one of the best boomer shooters out there. Right up there with the goats like Quake, Doom and Half Life, and has some genuinely scary moments. Only downside is the bosses being a little boring at times, but it might be my fault because I played on the 2nd hardest difficulty on my first play through. If you like boomer shooters, your gonna love this game!
