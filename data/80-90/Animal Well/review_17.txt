i would recommend this game, but it has real problems.  at first you are like wow one person made this and the design is tight and then you start dealing with the traversal and the backtracking and the incredibly terribly signposted ways youre supposed to deal with a few of the bosses (while others are criminally, stupidly easy, but which one for you might vary)... 
so basically, at that point when metroidvanias are supposed to be engaging, it just is really frustrating.  it's too big. it has too few ways to get around. too much backtracking, not enough clarity in what you're supposed to be doing and how. the way some levels dont connect to each other later on and you're desperately looking for where the hell you used a power, and you have to go through half a dozen screens over and over again. man. it's a real real bummer because there's really no need for it to be that way in my opinion.  i played all the dark souls games offline mode. but this is just not cool man.

anyway the point is im glad this game is so appreciated, but if you DO have problems with trying to figuure something out, you will find, because you have to search a bunch of angry forums, that you're not alone in feeling that there are a number of things that just aren't great about it.   i got all four flames and kinda fell off tho i do plan on finishing the last bit. idk if i'll do the ten thousand secrets tho. it's...incredibly tedious unless youre just following guides. i felt the same way about fez. so there you go.
