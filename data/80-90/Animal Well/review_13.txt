Astounding game, profoundly shocked me that whilst I had been playing, there are too many mechanics and from start to ending game I have felt the area of gaming, I have felt the olda days when I used to playing mario and packman in childhood times. 

You can feel the vibe with soundtracks which are going to play when you passed , for instances, among of from forest to arctic areas.

Nevertheless, it does not change the game to be challenging with boss fighting specifically in Cat fighting whose is chasing you to corner of map. 

You have to be passionate and must to collect pieces to use, in order to open some ways where firstly is closed.

There are some bugs that can be fixed by Billy. When you crashed the game some outstanding advandures not going to happen. 

The Rabbits, classifiedly they are hiding and the most hardest stuff to find them in game 

Long story shortly, in the end of day you will have been feeling in sweet home yourselves.

The Game is 8/10 from my side. I would like to find cheater ring and I would like to do %100 achievment.

Greetings.
