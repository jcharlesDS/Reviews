Secrets on secrets. I looked up a tutorial once. I realised I would have solved it myself if I just used the things that are given to me. Everything is there most of the time. The signs are there. it isn't completely hidden. Patience is a well needed. Also, sometimes you get stuck, if you've played the game for more than 10 hours, it probably means that you should focus on something else in the game.
Go watch videos about the making of the game. The story of the solo dev is great.
