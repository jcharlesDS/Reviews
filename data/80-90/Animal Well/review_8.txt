Animal Well is very atmospheric and confusing, but in a good way. Highly recommend for anyone interested in Metroidvanias, the platforming in the game is simple but you can do some insane tricks as well. Idk anything about the story though lol none of it really made sense to me, however, the game was interesting enough to keep me engaged to 100%
