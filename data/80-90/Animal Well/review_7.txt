Animal Well feels quite perfect in a sense there isn't anything more or differently I wish it does. Play it on steamdeck if you can, it is made for that kind of setup, I started it on a trip, and even after I got home I still play it on my steamdeck instead of monitor or TV. 

I'm not a Metroidvania fan and only really gave animal well a chance cause of its reputation and that dunkey said it's an easy game in his video...
The difficulty feels...fair, like I said, pretty perfect level for me.  And I probably agree it's an easy game.  

I really love the aesthetic and therefore can't really get mad when I revisit an old zone or running around looking for clues. So yeah actually really recommend for people who don't play traditional Metroidvania or don't enjoy 2D platform combat.  The exploration of animal well is so rewarding.
