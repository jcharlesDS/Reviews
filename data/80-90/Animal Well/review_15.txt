I really wish there was a "meh" option. I wanted to like this game a lot, but playing it felt more like a chore than anything. While a lot of the puzzles can be cool and rewarding when figured out, many sections feel frustrating just for frustrations sake. And really, frustration is a lot of the game. The controls to switch items - which often has to be done quickly and in specific patterns, will cause more deaths than the platforming itself. The map is a slog to get through and traversal feels more like a chore than entertaining. That being said, the graphics are charming, the puzzles CAN be entertaining, and there are some deep deep puzzles that will reward those who are into combing through every pixel of a game. That being said, the gameplay itself didn't make me want to do that level of investigation.
