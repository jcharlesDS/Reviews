Best puzzle metroidvania game EVER created, imo.

Back in the day I was amazed by such titles as FEZ / Tunic,
but these are not even close to quantity & quality of puzzles Animal Well has.

- Search every single wall for hidden paths & check map borders for disintegrity
- Look around for some useful codes hidden in the environment
- How about skill based platforming? Some areas sure require being concentrated
- The game gives you tools to proceed, how to use them it's up to you to decide
- AH. AND THE GAME AIN'T GIVE YOU ANY HINT OF HOW ANYTHING WORKS. FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF

If you love exploration and experments this game is totally for you!
God bless this developer, 11/10

P.S. the game starts after you see the credits
