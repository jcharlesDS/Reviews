Not much is explained here. Everything (I've discovered so far) has been found through experimentation, observation, and backtracking through areas I've already been to. The level of depth seems to be as deep as players are willing to go. I'm having a lot of fun so far and would recommend this to anyone who likes secrets and discovery... and animals! 

I enjoy how the animals are represented. They feel like they were created from a sense of purity and authenticity. From the animations, to the sounds, to their actions within the game, the animals feel real. I want to pet a cat now. They've been through a lot.
