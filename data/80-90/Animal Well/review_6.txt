I waffled on whether or not to recommend this, considering I bounced off it pretty hard but can still see the quality of a lot of the game. In the end, I decided to give it a thumbs down so that anyone looking at the negative reviews will be able to see the issues I had, rather than having my review lost in the thousands of recommendations.

I had two or three big issues. The first is that a lot of the movement tech using the items you find is very finicky. It's not a huge problem when you only need to do two or three bits of tech in a row, but you frequently have to do dozens. It gets old very quickly.

Second, why is there even death in this game? There's no real combat, although there are some "bosses" that you puzzle out how to get rid of. But overall, death is super annoying for no real benefit to the game. Plenty of things don't even damage you, like falling in water, instead just warping you back to last touched safe ground. Meanwhile, spikes and normal enemies do one damage (out of 4, with seemingly no way to increase your HP), but some special "super fun" enemies are straight up one hit kills, sending you back to the last save point, and not even fully filling your HP when you respawn. As a bonus, death also drops all your fireworks, so you get to hunt those down if you need them. It's not fun.

Finally, while I appreciate that there's lots of cool secrets... there's not much compelling me to find them. Secrets for their own sake are only so interesting, and most of the secrets you'll find before diving into the super deep stuff is just more eggs. It's dull.

Now, if you like secret hunting just for the sake of secret hunting, and you can deal with the obnoxious deaths and finicky movement tech, then you'll probably have a spectacular time with this. I can certainly see why so many people like it, but I just couldn't tolerate the annoyances, and I need more than secret after secret to motivate me in a game.
