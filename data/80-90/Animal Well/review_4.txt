Ok, so I've played all the way from the main boss manticore blue, to the giant god bunny giving me my moth metamorphosis, and what i thought was gonna be a fun and fair challenge slowly became a tedious grind. The game is good, aside from the obviously nice graphics and sound, the gameplay and challenge is also fun and engaging, at first. Inconsistancies and straight up unfair or extremely convoluted puzzle decisions grind enjoyment to a near complete stop, even if you are not looking to do the post-main campaign stuff.

It first started after beating the wolf, seahorse, and chameleon's second phase, i was stuck on the underground entrance and didn't know that the rat in the wheel(or the dog too) could be controlled by the yo-yo, as yo-yo's only effected otters and chinchilla's, and there was no in game implications that yo-yo's effected more than those two, so i had to find a walkthrough. 
Then once i unlocked and beat the underground area and manticore blue, i tried to get the rest of the eggs on my own, but at a certain point it became nearly impossible to find the last 15 or so, and i had to use youtube and the practically abandoned wiki to help me through. Pair that with the ARG crap it expects you to dig through to get the bunnies moth form, and this is my issue. 

Doing the post-blue manticore egg hunt sapped out most of the fun left to get from this game, and the only thing that somewhat redeemed it was the manticore red boss fight's end and finding bunny island. I hoped that doing the bunny hunt would give something more than a shallow new area unlock and more annoying puzzles, maybe lore to explain the cool world and its circumstances, or a new biome areas in the map, anything really, but all i found was conveluted puzzle after conveluted puzzle and so much ARG nonsense that forces the player at some point to look for answer tutorials. Unlike the eggs, i could barely find any bunnies on my own, and after finding out all these hyper-complex things you had to do to find most of the rabbits, I gave up and just followed tutorials and 2 helpful teleport exploits for the 3 dog room bunny that was nearly impossible to do the intended way. Puzzles should be fun, fair, and reasonably intuitive, especially if most of your gameplay pre and post-base campaign consists of them, and having a large section of them be so near-impossibly hard to find alone or straight up force the player to look for help is not good game design or very enjoyable at that level.

I had high hopes for this game when i wishlisted and bought it, and the main trailers seemed to show it all, a fair but challenging puzzle platformer with a beautiful setting and deep story to tell, i wasn't looking for perfection, but i was looking for something better than what i, and other players for that matter got. The achievement states tell me enough with less than 40% of players actually beating the main manticore, roughly 17% beating manticore red, and likely much less evolving to the moth(though there is strangely no achievement for it), weirdly most of the recent negative reviews had the highest number of thumbs up compared to most positive ones, and even the highest positive commenter was hesitant about giving this a positive review and actually addressed this game's biggest flaws while others rarely mention them. 
I wanted to like this game, and while i still like the concept, the potential for improvements such as a good in-game story and character development/world building in place of excessive ARG to motivate the player and some needed tweaks to later puzzles and areas make it impossible for me to excuse, and based on some of the things i've seen while looking for resources to finish the game(wiki, reddit, hell even in the reviews) it seems like the remaining people are either obsessive ARG addicts that are defending the worst parts of the game or the typical "pretty graphics" people who only bought and inflate the game's ratings based on the graphics, soundtrack, and the hype-train; yet likely never finished it in the first place :C
Hopefully Billy/BIGMODE make some better games, because while this still a good game with alot of potential, especially for a first time game developer, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who actually likes games for their gameplay and story.


6.5/10: 
Looking past the pretty colors and interesting atmosphere, fun is slowly taken out of experience post-blue manticore, with the annoying inconsistancy when looking for the last of the 64 eggs, to the straight CHORE of finding all the 16 bunnies and getting to the god bunny to get your wings due to the infection of ARG post-manticore red, the game's intriug slows to a stop as areas become annoying to navigate, repetative be in, and the world as a whole has no meaningful way of motivating player beyond even beating manticore red. A good first game but with very poor late-game design decisions; if you must buy it wait for a sale like i did(it's lowest is %25 off/22-ish dollars from what i've last seen).
