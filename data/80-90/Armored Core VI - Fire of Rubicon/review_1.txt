that game is so much fun, it's a shame that it's so short, i'm already redoing the campaign for the new content that can be done after finishing the game. the gameplay, the music, the visuals, the builds, the variety of ways to play, thanks for everything !

i really hope that we will see a DLC or a new game in less than 10 years.
