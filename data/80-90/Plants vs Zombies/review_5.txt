[h1]A timeless masterpiece[/h1]
I don't even know where to begin with. Plants vs. Zombies is probably THE most iconic tower defense ever made, a title that, its sequences, couldn't really get off its hands (you can cry now, EA). Countless spin-offs and sequences later, and this still kicks ass, for a good reason. Why? This game has all that you could ask. It took me a long time to finally buy this on Steam and get 100% achievements, but, man, it was worth it.
