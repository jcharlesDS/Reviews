100% Achievement Review: A quick review based on my experience completing all the (available) achievements.

Title: Plants vs. Zombies 

Summary: Tower-defense zombie game 

Personal notes: Plants vs. Zombies is a classic tower defense game that I played growing up. The series itself has gotten many sequels, some good like garden warfare and some not so good like PvZ 2 (don't hate me). I think that the original is still a great if not the best game. It has a very solid first play-through for a TD game and has a lot of replay-ability be it through NG+ or the loads of mini games/puzzles they have. Achievement wise this game surprised me, there are quite a few specific requirement achievements that were kind of hard but the three that I mentioned below were by far the worst. The tree of wisdom requires so much plant food(money) to grow and the two mini-game streak achievements took me like multiple hours of gameplay. Not only is it highly RNG based but it requires some knowledge and strategy, for this I would recommend a YouTube video if you are going to try and attempt this.  All in all, I would be quite surprised if you haven't heard of Plants vs Zombies and if you haven't, I would highly recommend starting with this one. It is an old but great classic.
