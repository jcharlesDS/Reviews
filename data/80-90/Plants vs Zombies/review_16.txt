absolutely play. it is much better than the m()|3!le version. a it is also a fun game with much to do, even after you beat the story mode. and even after you beat the whole game, you can mod it! with difficulty mods like Total Death, and Brutal mode, and expansive mods like DLC, there is near infinite fun in this easy to pick up and play game!
