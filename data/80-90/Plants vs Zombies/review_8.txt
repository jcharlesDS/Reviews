Plants vs. Zombies is the definitive tower defense game. Its visual concept is iconic, imaginative and memorable, making it stand out from others from its genre. You have the GREENEST THUMB known to MANKIND and your goal is to grow a wealth of plants to attack the EVIL ZOMBIES that want to come into your house and EAT YOUR BRAINZ! Awesome! 

After completing the adventure mode, there is still a ton of content to complete in this game, such as completing adventure mode for a second time with every plant unlocked, or tons of fun mini games and puzzles, giving it a WEALTH of replay value. It's fun! And at a modest price! Give it a go!
