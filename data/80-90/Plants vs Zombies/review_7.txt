I love this game! Before I downloaded this game I was not really playing video games. I never wanted to play games that felt too violent, but killing zombies is a no-brainer (pun intended!) This game is clever and fun and solvable. I enjoy it thoroughly and would probably have advanced much further in my career had I spent as many hours training for that! Have fun!
