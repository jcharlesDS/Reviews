As I've getting older I have hade a difficult time playing games. It seems like whatever I play I can't get into the game, no matter how much I want to play said game. It really depends on the game, altho I want to play it, it really comes down to what myself. Of all the games I own on Steam and of all the games I wish I would play, Plants VS Zombies was actually the only one I managed to play all the way through. It was so much fun, I did play it back when it came out, but didn't finish until now. I waish it had lasted longer, but for a game that came out in the year 2009, it really shows how well made games were back then. This was the best gaming experience I've had in 2025. What a great game!
