Really fun simulation game! It has a lot of funny illnesses and interactions. I've only played the base game so far but it seems like it has a lot of content. There are some items and achievements locked behind multiplayer, but it's been easy enough to find people playing through the Steam forums and groups. One really really annoying bug is that sometimes it will say you disconnected from the internet and stop progressing in the multiplayer tasks, and it seems like the only way to reconnect is to close and reopen the whole game. This happens fairly frequently (for me anyway), like once an hour ish. Other than that, it's been great!
