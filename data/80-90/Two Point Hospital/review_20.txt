If you have heard about TPH coming from the original Theme Hospital then you are in for a ride. TPH has pretty much addressed all of the annoyances in Theme Hospital with some excellent QoL improvements but the most important for me are:
1) saving room blueprints
2) exploded rooms are no longer inaccessible

In terms of level of challenge, it is very much in the “easy to learn, hard to master” category. Getting one star on any level requires a basic understanding of the mechanics but hitting three stars, especially on the later levels requires a high degree of optimisation, patience and some luck.

While the game gives you many ways of making your hospital look nice, these tend to be at odds with running it efficiently. For example things like benches, kiosks and cafes reduce the speed at which you can process patients. I found out that a well oiled hospital is not a pretty one.

This is one of a few games that I have gotten all achievements for. They are time consuming but all fair and perhaps some require a little luck to get through but mostly I would say they are skill based. You do need to indirectly play with others for some achievements but it is only in the context of multiple people on a group finishing a shared objective rather than actively playing with others.

Given the number of hours I played it has been a blast and I will no doubt be returning to this game time and time again over the years.

Highly recommended!
