"No Point Hospital" has a point in playing up until you reach teaching. Then, it turns into a slog of patiently being patient about staring at patients.

It is a fun light game, stirring the feelings I have for the immortal Theme Hospital game of my youth.
Today, at my age, I see hospitals more closely and they perform very different from what I was shown as a child in that game. I should sue someone.

Anyway, this game, becomes very boring very fast. Once you get training, all you really do is build up the core rooms, get untrained stuff, specialize them, and then you just wait for the goals to complete by themselves, usually without you having to do anything other than:
- Click "hire" to look for a good stuff member
- Click X on all you are provided until you are given a stuff member who doesn't combine being a nurse and being a doctor at the same time.
- Find a student stuff member.
- Teach him what you want him to be.
- Cure 1 billion patients at a cure rate of almost 100%.
- Next level - same thing.
- Next level - same thing.
- Next level - same thing.

At some point, I didn't even look at the game. I was just letting it run on fast mode and did something else while it was minimized to the toolbar.
Tells you a lot.

But you keep going because this hospital cures weird ailments but OCD is not one of them.
