Note : 👍

Super fun to play both casually as well as trying to min max and get everything perfectly efficient.

It's very easy to understand how to play and the game does a great job at explaining everything to you without being too hand-holdy.

Very nostalgic because it reminds me a lot of theme hospital, which I played a ton as a kid.

Great game, would recommend it to most folks.
