Note : 👍

I adore this game.

To make sure I gave a proper review, I have completed the game twice and currently on my third run.

I have all DLC (worth the money, especially if you get them on sale). 

It has varying levels of difficulty, challenges on each level, there's plenty of variety.

It can become a bit tedious building the same thing over and over, especially with placing loads of gold star awards to get a level 5 room (can we just purchase an expensive one time item??).

It has humour, nice strategy elements and challenges. Well worth the money I paid for this game.
