Yet another game I've done once on the PlayStation and now I find myself going through again on the PC.

Great game - Truth be told this one saved me in a bit of a "lull" I was having with gaming when it came out, I remembered playing Theme Hospital back in the day and thought I'd give this one a go to see what they'd come up with.

At at time when I couldn't really be bothered with yet another big open world or a loud shooter it kept me interested.

It's not a perfect game, there are certain things that annoy me about it - BUT - Overall its fun and engaging to play.

Building your own Hospital and managing the resources might not sound like an idea of a good time, but the humour is great, but never gets old - The game scales well giving you more to learn with each Hospital and certain levels bring in extra challenges to keep it fresh.

An example of what I don't like are things on certain levels when it expects you to take care of like Pandemics where there is an outbreak and you've to hunt down all the infected patients, all while trying to keep your hospital going - It can be quite manic and ruins some of the fun, especially as it's seemingly random when they pop up - So you can have just dealt with it and getting yourself straight and another one will pop up. Other times you barely have to deal with them. 

Another bonus from coming over from the PlayStation version is the DLC - There is WAY more DLC with the PC version than there was an PlayStation (or XBox) so there is more bang for your buck there.

Overall it's a great game with little annoyances, but they are easy to forgive and don't last that long and definitely don't annoy me to the point where I don't want to play.
