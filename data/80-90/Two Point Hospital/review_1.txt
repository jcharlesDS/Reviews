I tried this after enjoying museum for over sixty hours. Unfortunately Two point hospital is just not nearly as engaging or fun to play. I feels very stripped down and empty compared to museum. I did not encounter any technical problems or game breaking bugs, I just simply didn't enjoy it as much as I did museum which I am still playing.
