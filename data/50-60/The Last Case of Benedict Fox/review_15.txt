Absolutely amazing. Graphics/worldbuilding is otherworldly. I would say it's almost better than Ori's. Loved the darkness/occultism in it, the creative- inspirational items, ideas, the interesting characters, sound effects, the exploration, the not so easy puzzles... It's like the adult/dark version of Ori.  Really enjoyed it, until:

What I didn't like is my gravest problem with games: when you get stuck, and have to search the web/walkthroughs how to progress... That really breaks the immersion/enjoyment for me. Even with the option of "hate feeling lost", sometimes there is a pinpoint on map but no guidance of what to do once you are there. Same with the final boss fight: absolutely no hint as for what to do with the arrows, and you keep dying until get lucky or look up videos.. it was very frustrating

Some notes for the (hopefully coming) sequence: 
- look up "The Room" - short puzzle game, and implement their 3 step "Hint" system for puzzles/quests. The first hint is just a broad idea for what to look for, and with each hint you decide to take, it narrows the solution but still doesn't tell what to do exactly. This helps giving the player a slight push when their brain don't work at full capacity but still would like to play and progress. I know there is a "don't want to solve puzzles" button but that's just the other extreme. The hint system would be an excellent in-between.
- The quest notes were complete useless: "Find out what happened" "Find more camps" etc.. again: try to give hints or clues instead, or something more valuable than that, please.
- have more testers than that 3 listed in your team, please, because I don't know how they did not pick up on these issues. There is no way all 3 of them went through the game without ever feeling confused or lost.

I might feel harsh, but because I really wanted to give this a 10/10, so if there is a sequence coming (which is hinted), I hope you can do just a little bit better with more hints and clues and guidance for every level of intelligence.
