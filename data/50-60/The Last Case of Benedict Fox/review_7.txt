Wow, this game deserves a lot more credit then what it gets.

Cinematically it's a work of art. The art style is fantastic, I really felt like I'm finally playing a game that pays a worthy homage to Lovecraft. It loosely reminded me on The Case of Charles Dexter Ward which is one of my favorite stories, it felt great to be part of it. I enjoyed the puzzles very much (except maybe the tarot ones, since I had trouble with figuring out when the card has to be flipped), the combat felt good, especially as the upgrades are starting to get together. The story is good and the biomes / interconnected maps were very clever. 

My only issues were the occasional frame rate drops while the textures were still loading after teleportation, but if the game would've been installed on an SSD instead of HDD, this probably would have not happened.

I had a lot of fun playing The Last Case of Benedict Fox and I'm grateful for the experience. 
Thanks everyone who worked on it!
