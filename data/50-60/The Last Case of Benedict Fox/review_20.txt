Note : 👎

Pros:
1. Good puzzle
2. Metroidvania style with grinding, upgrade and backtracking

CONS:
1. The movement got choppy till at some point unbearable to play the game (After I play above 2-3 hours). I already lower the graphic quality to LOW and still choppy. The only fix is restart my PC and play again. But this is the problem that not suppose to happen.. 
2. The story telling is so confusing. When I played the game, at some point I want to finish the game as quickly as possible and DO NOT CARE THE STORY ANYMORE.
