The devs seem to have fixed all the bugs and issues that plagued this game upon release so credit where credit is due. I did encounter one bug where I turned ultra slow motion and couldn't do anything bar restart the game (I was unable to replicate it). Luckily there is a manual save in the settings which I don't think many people would find or at least, I didn't know about it until the above bug forced me.

The game looks incredible and the world building is awesome. It's almost Tim Burton-esque and surrounded in mystery, I thoroughly enjoyed the aesthetic and story.

The combat is basic but sufficient, it's a metroidvania so I wasn't expecting insanely difficult combat although some of the bosses took me a few tries to figure out especially the last boss. Once you start upgrading your weapons and skills you can easily wipe the floor with lesser mobs (ground slam is OP). Also, you don't need to kill mobs you have already killed as you won't get any ink, they are easily distinguishable so you can just run past them if collecting artifacts unless they are really hindering you.

You will most likely need a guide if going for all the achievements (I did). And you will still need to be able to read/decipher the code (I won't ruin it) in the game to complete the puzzles as some of the runes you get are random (so it seems) so you may not necessarily get the same runes as a guide. The code is one of the most intriguing parts though. Once you figure out how it all works, I loved figuring out the puzzles.

Overall I enjoyed my time, I new what I was getting into. The devs have also said they have learned a lot making this game and I'm curious to see where they go next so I will be dropping them a follow.

Edit: I wont be giving them a follow as you can't yet on Steam, I'll keep an eye out ;D
