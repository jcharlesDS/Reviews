Note : 👎

I wrote a longer review, but changing the vote removed it, so can't be bothered to write it again, I'll just summarize it instead.

Pros:
- Looks great visually!
- Wasn't too tedious to 100%
- Overall combat felt OK.

Cons
- Soundtrack absolute trash and this is the major reason to why I'm giving it a negative rating. For me, the soundtrack is a very crucial point in Metroidvanias. It sets the mood for the zones and it help with the immersion and creates memories. Big disapoint.
- Story's a bit to confusing. You just get thrown into the game and I couldn't really follow what the hell was happening, what the goal was and sometimes it wasn't very clear what the main next plot thing was. Bit messy.
- Triple jump just makes ramps uesless which led to some sequence breaks, although minor. Didn't see the point of them.
- Tarrot Card doors were just tedious.

Overall, I had an OK time with it, but this game didn't leave me with a "great feeling" after finishing it. I was just feeling "ok, that's it I guess". I think if more work was put into creating a memorable soundtrack and maybe make a better script, this game could have been alot better. I also think the reason I don't really want to recommend the game is that I'm not a very big fan of the setting of the game.
