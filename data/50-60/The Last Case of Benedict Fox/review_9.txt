It's really one of the best games I've recently played, the only problem which is a pity is that it's very poorly optimized, I couldn't beat the last boss because of constant drop frames even on lower resolution and with a 4090 32gb. I know the developers acknowledging that and it's fair because it's a very small team, so I won't blame that at all, I played it anyway with these small defects and still believe it's a wonderful title.
