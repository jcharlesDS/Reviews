An interesting indie metroidvania with a cool aesthetics, sadly plagued with bad voice work and bugs.

I really liked the gameplay and characters. The story, dispite being not so original and kinda obvious at times, was conveyed with very beautiful and interesting level disign. The puzzles were fun! Enemies were scarse, tho.
Additionally, the game have some options to customise your gameplay: make puzzles auto-complete or remove hints at all, make the combat more diffucult\easy, etc. Loved that too.
But as i said, the voice acting or actually voice direction was really bad (or even buggy sometimes). The dialogs are too fast, so they feel really unnatural. One time i had no audio at all. Huge let down for me.

Overall, this a good one-off game with very aesthetically pleasing visuals about detective with an eldrich demon in his head.

My score: 6 tatoos with tenticals, that gives you magic powers / 10.
