Note : 👎

I really liked everything about this game, except for two things: some of the puzzles and its performance on Steam Deck.
Regarding the pros: the plot, art style, and gameplay are great. That's why I managed to finish it despite the many performance issues.
There's an option to auto-solve some crazy puzzles. So I'm not going to complain too much about that (even though I still think it's a bad move).
Speaking about the performance issues: the game is barely playable on Steam Deck with comfort. I tried various options but the game isn't capable to provide you with stable 45 FPS even on the lowest settings (on which it looks terrible).

I don't want anyone to go through what I went through, so I don't recommend the game. I also hope that the next time Plot Twist programmers will spend more time on polishing the game instead of overcomplicating puzzles (yes, here I mean the piano puzzle).
