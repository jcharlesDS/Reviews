Good metroidvania with a cool Lovecraftian atmosphere. There are some minor technical issues with the game, mainly the long loading times and the backgrounds don't load on screen quick enough. Combat was nice, the gun is strong but starts off with one shot and you have to upgrade it later. Character upgrades made combat better. It was fun to grab enemies and just yeet them off cliffs and stuff. Enemy variety is a little basic there could have been a few more added into the game for each memory. Bosses ranged from normal dodge/attack type to a puzzle solving variety. Overall it was fun and the story was interesting so if you're into Lovecraftian stuff check it out.
