I've played through the entire game and its one of my favorites. Imagine "Ori and the Blind Forest", now add in eldrich monsters and Vemon's cousin in a side scroller and you have The Last Case of Benedict Fox. The visuals are stunning and the game plays very smoothly, not to mention there's lots of puzzles and collectables you can get. The only thing I didn't like about the game was the fact that the shadow areas are very easy to die in. Some puzzles don't come easily, but for that there's an option in the menu that can let you skip it if you want.

Plot wise, excellent and the ending had me tearing up a bit. Combat it takes a little getting use to, for sure all players should take a look at the tutorial arena. My overall rating: 8/10. Recommended.
