Note : 👍

I enjoyed this game a lot
Like: customize ow hard the game is for puzzles and/or fights.
Puzzles, and there really want you to look around and think, some harder than others but if you are stuck you can always use the option to skip a puzzle. 
The game looks really nice, I like the art style and environment in this game.
Dislike: some fights seemed a bit unfair, especially the last boss. Which made it all the more frustrating when you get through the game on default fights and switch to relaxed/immortal for the last boss.

Overall I had a lot of fun with this game and would recommand it.
