Note : 👎

I really wish I could. The game has some really good moments. I like the main character and his companion. Art style is nice. Combat has some fun moments.

But the more I play it the more frustrated I get

Puzzles where the control scheme just doesn't work

'Boss Fights' that are just frustrating and not even true fights

It's not a bad game. But my opinion has dramatically soured
