Incredibly fun multiplayer base defense game that forces you to constantly interact with an absolutely miserable single player survival game that checks all the mobile game boxes, from progress gated by real world timers to endless, repetitive material farming to restock your ammunition and consumables.

It's a real shame, too, because the weight of the combat and the intensity of the multiplayer sessions make for a great time with friends, but the single player grind you have to tolerate to engage with it is truly [i][b]insufferable,[/b][/i] and I promise you, there is [i]no way[/i] to simply avoid engaging with it. You [i]will[/i] wind up hitting softlocks in your multiplayer progress thanks to real world timers, staff levels, or resource availability in the single player portion of the game.

Avoid unless you have an extremely high tolerance to the exhausting mobile game elements. If you can put up with them, the multiplayer's a real banger, but as I progress further into haghood, I just don't have the patience anymore.
