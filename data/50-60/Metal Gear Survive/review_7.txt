really shockingly engaging both as an exploration-based survival game where getting lost is terrifying, and a base-building tower defense game. it is really painfully obvious what the game loses from not having kojima directing--the cutscene direction is EXTREMELY flat, and the story feels more like a resident evil game--but this is clearly not some soulless purroject void of creativity. metal gear survive is cool and unique.
