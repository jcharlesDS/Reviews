I didn't like this game at first, but I came back to it a few days later when I was in a different mood and played it until completion. The mechanics are solid. The story has plenty of twists and was surprisingly good. Once completed you can keep exploring, fighting hordes and expanding your base. A different but great addition to the Metal Gear franchise.
