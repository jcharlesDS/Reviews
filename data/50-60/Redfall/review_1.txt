I get that this launched badly, but I picked it up recently for a massive discount and tbh I absolutely love it. Have had zero technical issues at all so far, and I'm getting a solid 60fps across the board on max settings. If your idea of a good time is a Stephen King / Lovecraftian-esque open world vampire game akin to a more condensed Far Cry, with elements of Dead Island thrown in I'd honestly recommend Redfall. Absolutely love the small town Maine setting, and once you've levelled up a bit and have a couple of decent weapons on you, it's an absolute blast. Fun combination of story and side quests too, without the map being completely overrun with way too much stuff to do. I honestly feel like the team got a really bad rap here due to launch issues, and it's a shame as I would loved to have seen this do well and get a bigger sequel.
