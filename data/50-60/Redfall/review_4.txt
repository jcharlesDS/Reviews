Redfall – A Second Chance Worth Taking

I recently reinstalled Redfall after shelving it shortly after launch, and honestly? I’m impressed. This game had a rough start—no denying that. At release, it was plagued with performance issues, lackluster AI, and just felt unfinished. Like many, I dropped it with a sense of disappointment. But curiosity got the better of me, and after hearing about a string of updates, I gave it another shot.

I’m glad I did.

After diving back in, I spent around four hours exploring the vampire-infested world of Redfall, both solo and in online co-op with friends—and I can confidently say the experience is so much smoother now. The combat feels sharp and responsive, movement is fluid, and best of all, I didn’t encounter a single crash or noticeable bug. Lag? Gone. Enemies? Actually engaging. The improvements are real.

There’s a strange satisfaction in clearing out vampire nests or teaming up to take down cultist strongholds. The atmosphere is still there—creepy yet oddly beautiful in its own way—and with the technical issues ironed out, it finally feels immersive. The servers are also still very much alive, which was a pleasant surprise, especially when jumping into co-op with minimal matchmaking issues.

Do I wish this was the version of Redfall we got at launch? Absolutely. But sometimes games need time to become what they were meant to be. It’s clear the dev team has been working hard behind the scenes to get this title into fighting shape.

If you were burned at launch, I get it—but if you still have it in your library or you’re on the fence about trying it, now might be the time to give it a second look. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely playable—and more importantly, fun.
