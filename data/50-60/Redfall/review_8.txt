This Game had a rough start. But its now in away better state. I would definetly get this game ashot on sale. The Graphics are awasome and the Gunplay is very enjoyable. The Story is interesting too. The Characters can sometimes be abit cringe and theres a multiplayer bug, when getting past the first MAp where u have to do the first mission solo until multiplayer works again. But Overall Great Game!
