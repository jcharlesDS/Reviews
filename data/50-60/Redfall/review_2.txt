Note : 👎

I bought this game for really cheap.....and I feel like I got scammed. Even after all the patches this game has performance issues!

Do Not Buy This POS game......not worth even $5 tbh

cons:
-performance issues such as constant stuttering no matter what setting
-cringe dialogues and half as#ed cutscenes
-bad story in fact what story?
-boring generic mission design 
-non memorable music
-bad controller support - feels sluggish. Mouse was better but by not much

1.5/5
