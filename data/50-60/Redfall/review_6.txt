My advantage was that I’ve never played the game when it was released but in its final patch state and what can I say? It’s a solid game that is fun. Sure, the characters look a bit woke and the NPC (the priestess lol) is „special“ but meh. It’s actually a fine game. Not in my top games of course but I didn’t regret buying it on sale.
