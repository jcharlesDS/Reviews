Compared to the first Force Unleashed, this is a much more fluid and well constructed game. The graphics still hold up nicely, the mechanics are more comfortable, and the story feels more natural, though it's still pretty mediocre. Have to say though, the game is short. Very short. I beat it in less than 5 hours.
