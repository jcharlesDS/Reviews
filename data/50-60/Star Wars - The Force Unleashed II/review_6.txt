A shame they killed the franchise, this games has a lot of common with the older god of war titles. Statkiller feels like an absolute boss, as you blast through waves of clones. More refined combat than the first game, less bosses, rather short experience, with little to no replay value. Performance is also a bit weird, since this was an Xbox 360/PS3 port it is locked at 30 fps which you can easily bypass and for some reason cutscenes don’t work on Linux. As a Star Wars fan I totally recommend this
