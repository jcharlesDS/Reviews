Note : 👎

Let me start by saying this game has my favourite hack n slash gameplay of all time, if you want lightsaber and force combat and to feel like god, this is the game. the story pales in comparison with the first game, but it's still alright. HOWEVER, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC. I've never had a worse, more corrupted, buggy experience trying to play a game. once I finally got through chapter one, I was faced with a complete lockout - the intro cutscene for chapter 2 completely crashes the game. every time. I tried for as long as I could, but had to refund the game having only played the first level. From what I read, everyone seems to have a technical problem with this game, but it's different for everyone.

I recommend you buy this game, on Xbox, not pc. have played it on my xbox one s and it is perfect on there.
