Do you want to play the game above 30 fps, or you do want to watch cut-scenes?

Unleashed 2 isn’t good enough or a long enough game to justify the amount of technical bullshit it throws at you. Game-play wise, nothing from the original game was fixed, but a lot was improved. Parkour is less annoying, knock-back is less frustrating, while things unleashed did well originally, like combat, are outright amazing. The game also looks incredible for 2010 especially considering how ugly unleashed 1 looked. But story saw a massive downgrade and not because the premise was bland, but rather unleashed 2 has nowhere near enough time to tell its story. If you have nostalgia then buy it at a steep discount, otherwise just emulate it.
