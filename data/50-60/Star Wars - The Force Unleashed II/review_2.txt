Compared to its predecessor, the second installment of the Force Unleashed series holds up pretty well. The levels are gorgeous and the gameplay has some nice additions that make it more varied and keep it interesting. Despite having numerous crashes to Desktop, I still recommend this game. I just wish it would support 4K 60 FPS or preferably 120 FPS, so when is the remaster coming?
