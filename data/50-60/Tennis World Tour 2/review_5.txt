Note : 👎

It's a step forward to the shame that was the first version, but it's still not acceptable, and not enjoyable to play.
The team that released this game is either imcompetent, or did not have half the time they shall have.
Lots of bugs have been fixed since the release. But the pace of the game still slows down or speeds up randomly during points, even during a gaming vs the CPU...
The new strike mechanism inspired from the best tennis game of all time is the way to go, but the game pace has to be consistent for timing to work! 

The service mechanic is way too simple to master, you end up doing 80/90% of first serves at 230kmh that are super hard to catch.
The career mode forces you to play at a ridiculus level for too long. No kidding, a French 4th series player plays better than your character at the beginning of the career.

It's been now quite some time that I purchase tennis games just to show editors that there is a market for them, but I will stop buying these half-backed projects, I am tired of wasting my money.
