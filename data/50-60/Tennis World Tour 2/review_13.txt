Note : 👎

This game is bad as fuck. AI is way to strong for returning service. AI is never doing fault. AI hit harder than you with perfect timing each time.

Either you grind to have +10 rating than (and it's quite fucking long and cannot be done for slams) or you just just put down the difficulty, then the AI is going full monkey retarded.

This game could have been ok if AI was not fucking Rafael Nadal based for each of the fucking dude you encounter.
