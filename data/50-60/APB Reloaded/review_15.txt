while I wouldn't say this game is an absolute masterpiece, or some kind of hidden gem, It has it's ups and downs. Regardless of what anyone tells you, the games balancing is actually quite impressive, if anyone says other wise, they're dog shit at the game. 

The content, community, skill gap, this game kind of reminds me of gunz the duel, in the fact that it's a super old, decently underrated game that has a somewhat appealing combat system. The only difference is this game isn't marketable enough, or aesthetically pleasing enough to blow up on social media like gunz the duel did. At this rate, it seems like APB and their team has done everything in their power to try and revive this game and keep it's community alive, i personally believe the social media approach can be this games only saving grace at this point.
