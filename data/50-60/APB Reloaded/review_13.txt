I've got a few hours into this game and have had it for a long time.

It's honestly a lot of fun if you have some friends to play with you, customisation is insane.
relatable to the old school need for speed games, can make custom decals out of shapes to make any logo's you want really.

Can inter change car parts from different sets if you feel like spending on money on the game.
It's free, i always feel if you like a free game. spend what you think the games worth on it.

mostly just a third person shooter with deep character/vehicle customisation.
