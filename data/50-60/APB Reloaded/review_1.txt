[h1] With this message I want to address to the developers of APB Reloaded. [/h1]

 I love this game and I think I'm not the only one. Yes, there are many of us. We all, everyone who has ever played this game in one way or another loved it, maybe in its own way, maybe someone for just a couple of hours, but still it is so. I think this game left no one indifferent. Because this game gives something that do not give many games these days. It's uniqueness. I think you know what I mean. APB Reloaded offers you a unique game content, which you will not find anywhere else (maybe only similar, no more). 

But today, I'm going to be honest. The game is unique, but that's about it. 
APB Reloaded lacks content other than the unique content that is already in the game.

I suggest adding content that can take the game to the next level. In a game with 500 average online, with the data changed everyone can expect a couple thousand, maybe even tens of thousands. Here's what I'm talking about:

[h2] 1. Adding new activities for everyone. [/h2] For example: buying apartments with the ability to change the interior decor, buying businesses that will bring passive income, adding NPS, which will have their own storyline quests. Only these few ideas can FULLY change the gameplay of APB Reloaded, and such ideas can be thought of dozens more and each of them will bring their own colors to the game.

[h2] 2. Adding content for the Enforcers (Police) faction. [/h2] After playing 5 hours for this faction, I realized that there is nothing to do. They literally have no content. But it can easily be added. For example: police interaction with passersby NPC. This can be played by the fact that the police ask passers-by if they are doing well, and if they are not complaining about something. For this the cops will get money, just like robbers for robbing passersby. Cops need activities NOT just related to the opposing faction, they need THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES. 

[h2] 3. Events. [/h2] It would be good if the game would add various Battle Passes, temporary (seasonal modes), temporary events dedicated to various holidays and so on. This would all create the appearance that the game lives and thrives.

[i] These are just 3 ideas that would completely change the level of the game. And you can not stop at them and go further. Come up with something else. It's not that hard considering the style of the game. [/i]

[b] If you read this post and you love APB Reloaded as much as I do, then give it a like and let the developers notice it and take the game to a whole new stage. [/b]
