Absolute dogshit. Server crashing all the time they're "fixing it" all the time, game is full of cheaters (can confirm) full of un-balanced matchmaking (can confirm) (they always "fixing it" also) they dont ban the cheaters, their anti-cheat SARD is pure shit, there is no support, your ticket will be unanswered for like 6 months. As I've spent more than 1k hours in this garbage i'd advise you NOT to even try this game, it has no learning curve, no tutorials, no fair gameplay wise... they "fixing all of my listed nonsense for like 6 years now? dont believe it, dont even try it.
