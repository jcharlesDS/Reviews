This game is nothing but a cheating simulator. I really wanted to enjoy it, but the amount of cheaters in this game is unbearable. No matter how good you are, it feels like half the players you encounter are using cheats or hacks. It completely ruins the experience and makes the game feel more like you're playing against bots than real people.

The developers clearly don’t care enough to properly address the issue, as cheaters run rampant, and there's little to no action taken to ban or fix things. It’s frustrating to be killed by someone who’s clearly using aimbots, wall hacks, or other exploits, and it just kills any fun you can have in the game.

It’s a shame because the game had potential, but at this point, it’s just a frustrating mess. Don’t waste your time unless you’re okay with a never-ending cycle of cheating.
