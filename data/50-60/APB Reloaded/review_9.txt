This game is genuinely fun, the issues I have with it is there's no skill based matchmaking so it's quite difficult to actually progress as a new player. As far as micro-transactions go it's worse than a mobile game, criminals can easily make 25k an hour by smashing garage doors and fencing the loot. However enforcers it's like playing on the hardest difficulty you can barely earn cash, and there's nothing really to do if you don't get matchmade with a group. I waited almost 30 minutes just to get absolutely destroyed. I'm not a fan of the weapon renting system, back when I played a few years ago I had to grind just to rent a weapon worth a damn since the default gun is so terrible. Now I can't even make enough money to rent it anymore.
