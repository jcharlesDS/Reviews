Do not bother with this game, they are trying to resuscitate, and in doing so they unbanned a wave of hackers. This game has had a hacker problem since a few months into it's tenure, where they ran rampant and effectively killed the game. Now in unbanning these hackers, they are doing the same thing again even now in 2025. IDK why they thought unbanning them was a good idea, because now when people start to lose or get sweaty they just toggle them on and keep them on, they did not learn from their bans. APB's anti cheat system is a joke, and quite honestly this game deserves a grave by now given the piss poor handling of the situation that poisoned them in the first place. do not drop a dime on this, it will be throwing money away into the wind.
