OPINION:

-Pro: Good game, great gameplay, non-predatory and generous business model (even in D1), ability to create a real strategy, build your players, and create a roster that suits you. No transfer market, so no bots sniping and offering players high prices. Team of the Week is €1 per player (maximum 3 draws). Free updates from one year to the next, no need to spend €70 every year.

-♥♥♥♥: Lack of game modes and team options, but that will come.

I don't understand the bashing around this game.

For me, eFootball is a more than decent game. The gameplay is 10x better than EAFC, gone are the arcade side, the technical moves in space and the wingers who run as fast as the TGV, you have to build, and think about a real tactic, with players whose style of play works in your formation and who combine well. Of course, it is for the moment in a somewhat light version, no career mode, no master league mode for example.

Like its rival EAFC, it relies heavily on the "Dream Team" mode, which allows you to create a team from players you obtain through rewards, a bit of grinding, or via the gacha system. I spent €5 on the match pass, which I really enjoyed, and I have a more than decent team to complete all the challenges the game offers me. "Team of the Week" players cost €1 each, and you can pull them up to three times per week. It's not expensive at all if you like one of them from time to time. In this respect, I find the game to be incredibly generous, compared to FUT, which doesn't offer any "pity" system (automatic acquisition of a player after a certain number of attempts).

So yes, like in EAFC, there's no miracle. If you come up against a player who has invested €1,000 in the game, you'll have a more difficult match. But it's still possible to win if you're better than him, and especially if you have the right tactics, players with suitable techniques, and a formation that blocks his. You can change games directly to put your opponent in a disadvantageous position.

And that's where it's great: like FIFA, the game assigns specific roles (playing styles) to players, which influences their behavior on the pitch. A "destructive" DC won't do the same job as a "construction" DC or an "attacking" DC.
So you have to find the combination that suits you, the right playing styles, the right tactics, and the skills you want for each of your players.

The progression aspect of each player is also great. You can have the same player as your opponent, but as they level up, you distribute their points differently and then give them different techniques—in short, theorycraft.

All this means that Dream Team mode isn't just a gacha game; it's also a strategy you design and implement on the pitch. You can also change it live to counter your opponent's. Interesting.

It's free; give it 5-6 hours to see if you like it. No need to spend €70 like in EAFC :p
