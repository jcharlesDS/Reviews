JESUS. FUCKING. CHRIST. This... is the WORST FUCKING GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED. 3RD PERSON GAMEPLAY ON A ENGINE THAT"S DESIGNED FOR 1ST PERSON!? A MORALITY SYSTEM IN A FUCKING POSTAL GAME!? SHIT ESCORT MISSIONS!? SHIT CONTROLS!? GAME CRASHING EVEN THOUGH GAMES ON SOURCE ENGINE RUNS FINE ON MY COMPUTER!? WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUK. I'D RATHER DRAG MY BALLS ON A MILE OF GLASS, I'D RATHER TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH A CACTUS, I'D RATHER HAVE A THREESOME WITH CHERRI BOMB AND ANGEL DUST FROM HAZBIN HOTEL. CUZ THOSE 3 WOULD GIVE ME JOY! BUT THIS GAME!? NO, I HATE THIS COCK SUCKING GAME, I HATE IT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH. Running With Scissors deserves a APOLOGY. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK THIS GAME. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS COREY CRUISE. Thank GOD the man was added as a optional voice in Postal 4. FUCK THIS GAME.
