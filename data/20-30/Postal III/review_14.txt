There is a game here, i can see the potential. honestly tho if you aren't a hardcore postal fan and even if you are i don't think i could recommend it. the amount of times i had to reload a level because a door is broken. that was the biggest problem, the doors would break all the time and i think it was because their was enemy's behind it, but even if you manage to kill them the door stays broken. the prison escort mission was the worst, i was on it for like 2 hours for a 15 min mission, i didn't even die, not once. the level was just that broken, i ended up reloading the whole level more than 3 times. also the new big thing here is taking cover but 40% of the time Dude just wont shoot behind cover. theirs other stuff to complain about but its mostly nitpicks. is there anything good? sure. the soundtrack for the most part is great. there's not much challenge so i had time to jam out to the music, except for the tutorial level, its got some weird lullaby. i also don't mid the shooting, there is flaws but the guns feel pretty well to shoot, melee not so much but guns are okay. honestly overall, if your a postal fan and you wanna play this part of postal history then i would recommend it. if your pretty new to postal, just go play postal 2.
