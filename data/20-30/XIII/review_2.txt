Note : 👍

I was surprised to see all the negative reviews for this game.
 
Granted I never played the first game or was aware of it, I only picked this up because a friend recommended it to me and it was dirt cheap and steam deck verified.
 
It’s a really fun game with a cool aesthetic and solid gameplay mechanics. I really don’t get the hate.
 
My only complaint is that the final level bugged on me after rescuing the president, the vault door wouldn’t open and I had to start the level over again and thankfully it worked properly the second time.
 
Also the ending was whack and unfulfilling but overall if you are a fan of FPS games this is a must play, especially when it goes on sale for under $2
