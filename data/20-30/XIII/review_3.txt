I only played this for about half an hour. I've experienced what the game offers, but I haven't actually sat down and played it. From my initial impression, it's not an awful game. Don't get me wrong, this game has no purpose. The original game is leagues better in almost every way. However, if you are a fan of the original game, and would like to collect achievements for your progress, this is an alternative. If you do buy this game, grab it when it's on sale. This game dropped in price quicker than any other game I've ever seen in recent memory. Maybe Tony Hawk 5 dropped its price faster, but they are really close.
