The game is a classic fps first-person shooter. [b]Story[/b] is not directly embedded on the film, but is mentioned here, [spoiler]the plot is about one survivor who is in the NVA prison, which wakes up in the middle of the slaughterhouse. Who caused it? You will never find the truth.[/spoiler]

The [b]acting[/b] is average, but it doesn't change the fact that you will have a [u]brainwashed.[/u] A game suitable for [spoiler]schizophrenics[/spoiler].

[b]Enemy intelligence[/b] is absolutely stupid, enemies are spawning right in front of you. And when they see you how you hide behind an obstacle, they are literally [i]helpless.[/i]

The [b]graphics[/b] aren't important i think, but for year 2009 won't impress, [u]but![/u] the main problem is that something is [i]wrong[/i] with the game. [u]Absolutely all vegetation is missing[/u] If the license for the part of the used software  [b]SpeedTree technology : Interactive Data Visualization, Inc.[/b] expired at the time of release or has it been removed due to HW difficult? I don't know. Anyway, it's nice to see the difference between [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139050531] final game[/url] and the [url=https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/31300/ss_505ccc94cbf59941b5b93e225bf400bff687f7fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447351855] pre-release[/url].

[b]Compatibility:[/b] Don't expect to run the game on Win8/10. I only succes on old Windows 7, but I was unhappy about it because is it challenging for my PC about how empty the game looks.

[u]Put your hands away. In this waiting for you tunnels maze, later quite annoying traps, stupid enemies, bugs. This product is not even worth a lousy 2 euro. And to want 19 euros for this? Oouuu... to hell![/u]
