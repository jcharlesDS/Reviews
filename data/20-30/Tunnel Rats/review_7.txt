The Good:
You get to shoot Commies.
Uhhh...  you can collect ears (Vietnamese) and dog tags (Americans) to gain more total health.
Did I mention you can shoot Commies?

The Bad: 
Graphics are at best passable - character and weapons models are subpar, but some of the outdoor areas look nice.
AI is stupid - tactics consist of standing in position or charging at you.
Buggy weapons - knife hit detection is bad. Throwing hand grenades can result in grenades stuck in midair or your character throwing invisible grenades. The grenade launcher has the same problem. Ironsights are useless.
Certain levels had areas that appear to be unfinished - one outdoor level had a snake trap hanging in midair.
Traps get repetitive and annoying after a while.
You are forced to listen to your character's insipid, psychotic ramblings throughout the game.

Conclusion: You may as well throw your 20 dollars into the street.
