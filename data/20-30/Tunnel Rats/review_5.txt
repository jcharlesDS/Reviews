Note : 👎

With frequent glitches, terrible gameplay, dreadful cutscenes, and a loathsome main character, Tunnel Rats is a miserable experience from start to finish. The game’s few strengths are vastly outnumbered by its apocalyptic failures. It’s too short for the asking price, but also way longer than it needs to be. 

The fact that this game still costs $20 is either an egregious oversight or a deliberate tactic by Steam to prevent more people from playing the game. It truly is a game worthy of Uwe Boll’s “stellar” reputation. Stay far away from Tunnel Rats.
