First off it's not simple to get even the game running, in fact I had to install and to play it on my old windows 7 laptop, using also some fixies from the web because it does not work on modern computers, and apperently there is no support or instructions how to get it work from the developer (now defunct) or the pubblisher... 
Second the game is bad and looks pretty unfinished, with boring and uninspired locations like the jungle and the tunnels that most of the times will look like all the same, so you will have the sensation to play the same level again and again... Also many times the camouflage traps can be hard to be seen on the surface parts of the game, and this makes it even more frustrating because auto-save checkpoints are not that common (you cannot save manually)... Also the iron sights of the weapons many times will not work correctly and the main protagonist will never shut up for the whole game, saying boring or stupid things most of the time (except when he insults communists of course, that's a good thing).
There are still a couple of not so terrible things in the game like a semi decent graphic (at least for a 2009 game), a not bad menu song, some violence and a depressive athmosphere, but it will all cost you almost 20 bucks when the game today should cost probably not more than 2 ... 

I liked Velvet Assassin from the same developers, but this one definetely is not worth it.
