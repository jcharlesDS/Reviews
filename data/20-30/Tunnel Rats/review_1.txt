$20 is asking far too much for this game. Whoever's responsible for pricing this garbage doesn't deserve to keep their job.
It's a 3 hour shitfest, and that's including getting lost in level 2 and playing on Hard. It's an xbox 360 game that keeps all its 360-related code and content (achievement icons, controller info, etc.) but wasn't allowed to release on the platform.

Visuals straight out of 2001, except the flashlight casts shadows and there's some barely noticeable bump mapping. FOV is alright though.

Weapon handling is awful, none of the guns are worth using, ADS helps precisely 0%, staring at the ground and mashing the use key is mandatory to avoid floor traps.

Mediocre voice acting.  Terrible story with a "twist" ending (hint: you get killed because of some bullshit) and a protagonist more worried about his daddy issues and his girlfriend than using the radio he has in his hands to communicate with the squad he's trying to catch up with. 

If you have equipment newer than say, 2008, don't expect it to work. If you have a gaming laptop that has that hybrid NVIDIA and Intel GPU switcher or have only an Intel iGPU, it'll work (slowly) on that.

Recording for youtube is the only reason to ever touch this garbage, and I'll even say right on steam: Pirate it instead. Not like the development company is around to get paid for making it, they're bankrupt because of this.
