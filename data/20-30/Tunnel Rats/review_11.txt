First things first. The game is broken and as far as I know....is currently unplayable. The developer went bankrupt after they released this game and nobody is around to do any kind of patchwork on it now. But with that being said....I did play the game when it was first released. The graphics were servicable. Far from good....but not horrible either. There were a handful of weapons that you could alternate between....however the grenades only had a 1 in 100 chance of working properly. The game had a few interesting features....namely the large assortment of traps that you had to either difuse or sidestep....and the fact that you could actually collect dogtags and severed ears. I heard that by collecting them it increased your health bar....but I never saw any significant improvement in that area. At $20 the game is ridiculously overpriced and even back in the day when it ran without a hitch....the gameplay only provided a few hours of play worth no more than $5.
